Powered by a centralized software catalog, Backstage restores order to your infrastructure and enables your product teams to ship high-quality code quickly — without compromising autonomy.

At Spotify, we’ve always believed in the speed and ingenuity that comes from having autonomous development teams. But as we learned firsthand, the faster you grow, the more fragmented and complex your software ecosystem becomes. And then everything slows down again.

By centralizing services and standardizing your tooling, Backstage streamlines your development environment from end to end. Instead of restricting autonomy, standardization frees your engineers from infrastructure complexity. So you can return to building and scaling, quickly and safely.

# Build an ecosystem, not a wilderness

## Manage all your software, all in one place

Backstage makes it easy for one team to manage 10 services — and makes it possible for your company to manage thousands of them

Every team can see all the services they own and related resources (deployments, data pipelines, pull request status, etc.)

All that information can be shared with plugins inside Backstage to enable other management features, like resource monitoring and testing

## Not just services

Libraries, websites, ML models — you name it, Backstage knows all about it, including who owns it, dependencies, and more

# Standards can set you free

## Like automated getting started guides

Using templates, engineers can spin up a new microservice with your organization’s best practices built-in, right from the start

## Push-button deployment

Click a button to create a Spring Boot project with your repo automatically configured on GitHub and your CI already running the first build

## Built to your standards

Go instead of Java? CircleCI instead of Jenkins? Serverless instead of Kubernetes? GCP instead of AWS? Customize your recipes with your best practices baked-in

When the right way is also the easiest way, engineers get up and running faster — and more safely

# Build your own software templates

![Backstage%20Software%20Catalog%20and%20Developer%20Platform%20%20c35ac842faa546ab8e8de7a80a540e66/techdocs-static-mobile.png](Backstage%20Software%20Catalog%20and%20Developer%20Platform%20%20c35ac842faa546ab8e8de7a80a540e66/techdocs-static-mobile.png)

Whenever you use a Backstage Software Template, your project automatically gets a TechDocs site, for free

With our docs-like-code approach, engineers write their documentation in Markdown files right alongside their code

Updating code? Update your documentation while you’re there — with docs and code in the same place, it becomes a natural part of your workstream

Since all your documentation is in Backstage, finding any TechDoc is just a search query away

# Manage your services, not clusters

## Kubernetes made just for service owners

Backstage features the first Kubernetes monitoring tool designed around the needs of service owners, not cluster admins

## Your service at a glance

Get all your service's deployments in one, aggregated view — no more digging through cluster logs in a CLI, no more combing through lists of services you don't own

## Pick a cloud, any cloud

Since Backstage uses the Kubernetes API, it's cloud agnostic — so it works no matter which cloud provider or managed Kubernetes service you use, and even works in multi-cloud orgs

## Any K8s, one UI

Now you don't have to switch dashboards when you move from local testing to production, or from one cloud provider to another

# Customize Backstage with plugins

# An app store for your infrastructure

## Add functionality

Want scalable website testing? Add the [Lighthouse](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/04/06/lighthouse-plugin) plugin. Wondering about recommended frameworks? Add the [Tech Radar](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/05/14/tech-radar-plugin) plugin.

## Integrate your own custom tooling

Building internal plugins lets you tailor your version of Backstage to be a perfect fit for your infrastructure

## Backstage is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) sandbox project

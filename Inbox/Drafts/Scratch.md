### Unit Test

- Unit test coverage should be greater than 90%
- Should write atleast one unit test for a method
- Unit tests should check the behaviour, not the logic
- Unit test should have low coupling to code 
- Unit tests should be decoupled from the implementation details, means your tests are specifying system behavior, without caring about the implementation details. Refactoring code doesn't affect the tests, only changes in the API affect the tests
- Should assert, The method from respective service have been called
- Should assert, The method from respective service have been called with proper arguments
- Should assert the few important fields from the output 
- Should check atleast one negative/failure flow

## Waterfaller does it better

A lot of apps report on what's wrong with your page. Our algorithm, however, creates complete user stories tailored to your page.

## Convert insights into successful development

Many web vitals can't be corrected without code changes, that's why it's critical to be able to speak the language of developers. Waterfaller is a one-of-a-kind tool that turns PageSpeed Insights into the agile tasks commonly used by developers.

The interactive waterfall will show you how the browser builds your page and pinpoints the files that are slowing it down. You get complete technical understanding of your page.

Utilizing a custom audit library and the latest research, our algorithm tunes the results to ensure you will find the next best fix customized to your page.

Tasks are written as user stories with complete testing criteria, so you can confidently work with developers on their next sprint.

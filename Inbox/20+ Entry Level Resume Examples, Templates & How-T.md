An entry level resume is a resume written by recent graduates or any candidates with little experience. It's usually created for jobs that don't require much expertise in a given field or profession. Entry level resumes are usually made for positions that will become stepping stones to a new career.

In a few minutes, you'll know how to write yours. But first—

Meet the hiring manager. Her name's Jane. Nice chia pet. Jane guards the job you really want. The one with great pay, great benefits, and dare we say... onsite health care?

**But there's a problem.** She only wants people with experience: 5–10 years is best, but at least 1–2.

You're an entry-level applicant. So here's the question: how do you write an entry-level resume that'll spin Jane's head around like a pinwheel in a centrifuge?

**This guide will show you:**

- An entry-level resume example better than 9 out of 10 others.
- How to write an entry-level resume that lands more interviews.
- Tips and examples of how to put skills and achievements on an entry-level resume.
- How to describe your experience on a resume for entry-level jobs.

Here's a sample resume for an entry level job made using our resume builder.

**One of our users, Nikos, had this to say:**
[I used] a nice template I found on Zety. My resume is now *one page* long, not *three*. With the same stuff.

## **What's the Best Format for a Entry-Level Resume?**

**Congratulations!**

Out of 350 entry-level resumes, the hiring manager put yours in the "read again" pile.

Your secret isn't earth-shaking.

You just picked the right format for your entry-level resume.

**Here's why format matters:**

A bad college resume format buries your best qualities.

In *most* cases, use a reverse-chronological layout. It shows your best achievements first.

Use big headings, simple fonts, and white space to give the eyes a rest.

Keep it to one page. A resume for entry-level applicants is an [elevator speech](https://zety.com/blog/elevator-pitch), not a Russian novel.

Finally, spell check. Nothing says, "needy employee" like a bunch of resume mistakes.

**Pro Tip:** Save your great entry-level resume as a PDF, since those preserve their format. Just make sure the job offer doesn't prohibit PDF resumes. Some do.

## **How to Write a Resume Summary or Resume Objective**

Meet Kate, the inexperienced job candidate.

She's tossing and turning, and it's 3 am. How come?

Because she knows the average recruiter spends just **seven seconds** with each resume, as our [HR statistics](https://zety.com/blog/hr-statistics) report shows.

**Now the good news.**

The right **entry-level [resume** **introduction**](https://zety.com/blog/resume-introduction) can turn that time into a job.

A **resume summary** lists experience if you have lots of it. You shouldn't use it as an entry-level candidate.

A **resume objective** shows your goal. It's good for beginner resumes, but some experts say to shun it.

Here's the trick: merge the two, and you'll blow the other applicants out of the water.

Look at these two computer science entry-level resume objective examples:

### **Two Entry-Level Resume Objective Samples**

First, a traditional college student resume objective:

What's wrong with it? It's needy but doesn't offer much. It'll sink like an X-Wing in the swamps of Dagoba.

But look at this next entry-level resume example:

In a [first-time resume with no experience](https://zety.com/blog/resume-with-no-work-experience), the second of those samples really does the job. The hiring manager just stopped playing with her Fitbit.

But the real magic is, it didn't take a lot of time to build up that experience. Just a few side projects.

Now look at two entry-level business analyst resume objective examples.

### **Two Functional Entry-Level Resume Objective Samples**

Once again, we'll start the old-fashioned way.

*Enthusiastic Business Analyst, skilled in leadership and communication. Seeking to enhance understanding of key metrics for IPSoft. As business report writer for Valens Securities, grew employee grasp of key concepts by 37%. My PowerPoint presentation of GBMP's Policy Deployment plan was turned into a webinar that got 1,400 views.*

Look at the second of those basic resume samples. It'll get the recruiter to put down her Shake Weight.

Why? Because it's really a resume summary for an entry-level job. It adds experience where normally you wouldn't see it.

Now the $64,000 question:

How did a complete noob get experience like that?

I'll show that next.

**Pro Tip:** A great entry-level resume objective should be an eye-catching [resume profile](https://zety.com/blog/resume-profile). It should read like an experience-stuffed resume summary, even though it isn't one. So include a couple attention-getting tidbits to whet the manager's appetite.

When making a resume in our builder, drag & drop bullet points, skills, and auto-fill the boring stuff. Spell check? *Check*. Start building **[your resume here](https://zety.com/resume-templates)**.

When you’re done, **[Zety’s resume builder](https://zety.com/resume-builder)** will score your resume and tell you *exactly* how to make it better.

## **How to Write an Entry-Level Resume with No Experience**

**"Nobody hires a noob."**

Said people who get jealous when new employees get a job.

First rule: positions that insist on 1-2 years experience are often flexible.

Plus, it's easy to get experience fast for almost any job.

**When writing entry-level resumes for students with no experience:**

**First**, scour jobs you've had in unrelated fields. If you're aiming for an IT job, did you upgrade a computer in a waitressing job once? Or install some software in a construction position?

**Second**, get experience from little projects. Freelance. Volunteer. Take side-jobs. Look online for one-off gigs.

Even a task that takes a couple hours can look great on a resume for entry-level positions.

Check out these two data analyst entry-level resume examples:

### **Examples for Entry-Level Resumes with No Experience**

Here are two resume examples for students with no work experience.

**Freelance Data Analyst**

2012 - 2017

- *Created a Python script using data analytics to rank Tennis ATP players depending on player stats. Client rated the script "extremely useful."*
- *Performed multiple linear regressions for a project to predict labels for unlabeled data.*
- *Created a machine learning algorithm to forecast supply needs in a busy restaurant based on past receipts. Cut inventory costs 25%.*
- *Wrote an API script to find highest-potential keywords for a lifestyle blog. The work resulted in 50% traffic increase in first 3 months.*

**Data analyst experience:** I'm fresh out of college with no experience in data analytics yet, but I'm driven to succeed!

**Other Experience**

- Blogging
- Waiting Tables

That first sample for an entry-level resume will make the hiring manager stop daydreaming about *Sharknado*.

It's still a resume for a first job. It still doesn't list 2+ years of experience. In fact, most of the experience it shows comes from summer jobs in college, freelance gigs, and [volunteering](https://zety.com/blog/volunteer-work-on-a-resume).

Let's see that again, this time with a sample for an entry-level resume for a computer science job.

### **Entry-Level Resume Examples for Computer Science**

Look at these two college student resume examples with little experience:

***Computer Science Experience:** None yet. I just received my degree. But I promise I'll work really hard!!!*

***Other Experience***

- *Waiter*
- *Retail Clerk*

You probably gained some [relevant experience](https://zety.com/blog/relevant-experience) from working on projects. Don't underplay that like the candidate above.

Do it more like this:

***Computer Science Projects***

*2012 - 2017*

- *Created an ecommerce site to sell walking sticks. Used PHP, MySQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and RoundCube. Complete with customer database.*
- *GitHub project: "tensorflow." Fixed faulty GPU kernel with int32 and int64 tensors. Also helped add FPGA Implementation.*
- *As retail clerk in a mom & pop, debugged online store.*
- *As waiter, created online menu site with ordering function.*

That second entry-level resume example will alter the recruiter's galvanic skin response.

And all it took was looking at past projects, and a little volunteering. Presto. Instant experience on a resume for a college student with no work experience until last week. Plus, [action verbs](https://zety.com/blog/resume-action-words) give those bullet points a polished look.

See the [example resume](https://zety.com/resume-examples) at the top of this guide for more. It also works as a [resume template for teens](https://zety.com/blog/teen-resume-example).

**Pro Tip:** Looking for quick experience for a resume for entry-level jobs? Google your industry's name + "Reddit" + "how to get experience."

## **Is Your Education Section Wet Behind the Ears? It Might Be**

**"We've got to hire this one."**

The education section of your entry-level resume can make the hiring manager say the words above.

It works even if you didn't graduate from MIT.

How?

Just pick education bullet points that fit the job offer like spray-on pants.

It doesn't even matter if you've only been to high school.

**Start with:**

- School Name and Location.
- Years in School.
- Degree.

Then custom-fit those bullet points:

### **Two Entry-Level Resume Examples – Education**

Look at these two college student resume examples:

***B.S. in Computer Science***

*Penn State*

*2012 - 2016*

- *GPA 3.5*
- *Received computer science degree*

Okay, so you went to school. You studied some, but not enough to ace it.

Now let's show a different side of you:

***B.S. in Computer Science***

*Penn State*

*2012 - 2016*

- *Excelled in software engineering and programming coursework.*
- *Active member, Student Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)*
- *Received Schreyer Scholarship to study ecommerce.*
- *My article in the school paper on mobile computing was linked to by Techdirt.*

Poof. Suddenly the frog has turned into a prince, and he's got dental coverage.

To work this trick, just sit down with a pen, some paper, and the job offer. Find the lures in your past that speak to the recruiter's heart.

For more help, use the sample college student resume template at the top of this article.

**Pro Tip:** Should you add a GPA to a professional entry-level resume? If it's impressive, yes. Otherwise, it's a waste of the hiring manager's precious time.

Give your college student resume's education section the old college try. See this guide: ***[How to Put Your Education on a Resume [Tips & Examples]](https://zety.com/blog/education-on-resume)*** and ***[How to Include Relevant Coursework on a Resume](https://zety.com/blog/relevant-coursework-resume)***

## **How to Put Skills on a Resume for an Entry-Level Job**

There's the earnest hiring manager. Her hair's a cyclone. Her eye-veins look like a map of greater Cleveland.

The culprit? A zillion entry-level resumes, all with the same skills list.

Listing skills is fine. But to get attention like a fireworks display, you need to walk the talk.

How?

**First**, focus on the skills shown in the job offer.

**Then** demonstrate those skills, like this:

### **Entry-Level IT Resume Sample Skills and Experience Section**

Let's say Karen's job description is in the IT field. It lists these skills: **hardware installation, security**, and software **installation**.

So, you add those to your basic entry-level resume, plus **training** for extra flair.

Here's the real secret:

**Tie them to your experience, like this:**

- **Installed** new retail **computer system** in a busy flower shop. **Trained** 5 staff members to use new payment processing system.
- Performed risk analysis for fast-paced doctor's office. Closed **security** holes in network, reducing breach and HIPAA risk by 95%.
- **Installed** new inventory tracking **software** for high-end bakery. Reduced inventory costs by 35%.

Wow, right? The hiring manager just forgot that awesome hipster meme she saw this morning.

Now, what skills should you add?

### **List of Skills to Put on a Entry-Level Resume**

Of course the *hard* skills in a resume for entry-level jobs depend on your field.

If you're in data entry, you'll need 10-key typing skills. In customer service? Maybe Zendesk and MS Office.

But there are certain soft skills that look good on any entry-level resume.

### **Best Entry-Level Resume Skills ("Soft" Skills)**

- Leadership
- Communication
- Detail Oriented
- Teamwork
- Self Motivated
- Honesty
- Adaptability
- Physically Fit
- Listening
- Problem Solving

- Interpersonal Skills
- Compassion

If you use the trick above, recruiters will notice you like you've been dipped in neon feathers.

**Pro Tip:** Don't lie about skills on your college student resume. If you do, you'll get tripped up in the interview.

## **How to Add Certifications to Entry-Level Resumes**

*"OK. This young woman knows her stuff."*

Certifications on an entry-level resume can make the hiring manager say just that. They can put you way ahead of other applicants.

But how should you display them?

If they're central to the job offer, put them in a special certification section, like this:

### **Accounting Certifications**

- *Certified Public Accountant (CPA)*
- *Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)*

If a certification is important enough, you can also show it after your name. You can even add it to first-time resume job descriptions.

You won't see high school student resume examples with certifications like CPA or CFA. But relevant certs like CPR or CDL are fair game in a high school resume.

**Pro Tip:** Display certifications central to the job offer first. Consider leaving unrelated certifications off a resume for an entry-level position.

## **How to Add Other Sections for an Effective College Student Resume**

*"He doesn't have 10 years experience. But..."*

What can you do to stand out when you're an entry-level applicant?

**You can show you're a good fit with the right "other" sections.**

I'm not talking about, "I watched every episode of Buffy 12 times."

I'm talking about facts that stick you to the job like an electromagnet.

That could mean testimonials, awards, test results, articles you've published, or anything else that gets attention.

### **Best Entry-Level Resume Sample "Other" Sections**

### **Programming Languages**

- *Java, C++, C#, PHP, MySQL*
- *HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery*

### **Conferences**

- *QCon New York*
- *Velocity Conference*

### **Awards**

- *3rd Place, SpOJ.com CodeWar*

### **Additional Activities**

- *Attended Code For Princeton Hackathon 2016.*
- *President, TrogdorPenn gaming group. Increased attendance 250%.*
- *See my professional portfolio at mikeveres.com.*

What "other" items will look good on an entry-level resume for your profession? Search for awards in your field, conferences, meetups, associations, and online competitions.

Don't discount writing articles or making videos about your industry. Even regularly listening to an instructional podcast can give a boost.

**Pro Tip:** In a job that calls for calm, even yoga classes can make a good entry-level resume addition. Take some time to think what activities will fit the job description.

## **Here's the Most Common Myth About Cover Letters**

"Nobody reads cover letters."

That's a bigger fib than Santa eating a free lunch with a minotaur..

Half the hiring managers don't read cover letters. To the others, they're essential.

That's why your great entry-level resume deserves an equally good entry-level cover letter.

**The good news is, they're easy.**

Keep your cover letter short and sweet. Use the hiring manager's name to make it personal.

Show you understand the problem. Then suggest how you can help.

You can add a fact you like about the company as well.

Then end it with a call to action. "I'd welcome the chance to talk about your needs" works great.

**Pro Tip:** Didn't get a call right away? Follow up to give your best entry-level resume and cover letter another chance.

Plus, a great cover letter that matches your resume will give you an advantage over other candidates. You can write it in our **[cover letter builder here.](https://zety.com/cover-letter-builder)** Here's what it may look like:

## **How to Add Contact Info to Your First Time Resume**

**Did you botch your contact info?**

If you're like most, you probably did.

**Of course you listed:**

- Full Name
- Updated Phone Number
- Professional Email Address

**Like this:**

> Michael Veres, michaelfveres@gmail.com - 215-290-8372
> 

But did you add a LinkedIn profile? Turns out 87% of all recruiters say they look at LinkedIn before they interview.

**Pro Tip:** Need a great LinkedIn profile for your professional entry-level resume? Check out our **[LinkedIn builder guide here](https://zety.com/blog/optimize-your-linkedin-profile)**.

Even with great entry-level templates to follow, writing your own is hard. Follow these tips to write the best resume for an entry-level job:

- Fit your entry-level resume to the job like spandex. To do it, read the job offer, then customize your bullet points.
- Put resume objective just below your contact info.
- The education section of even a high school student resume should pull its weight. Use it to show your schooling prepped you for the job.
- Add "other" sections that show you've got the chops. Anything that proves your job-related skills is fair game in an entry-level resume.

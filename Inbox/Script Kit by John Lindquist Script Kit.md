## What is Script Kit?

How often do you avoid scripting something because it takes too much effort?

Script Kit makes it easy to create and run scripts that solve your daily problems. Create a new script from the prompt then your script opens in the editor of your choice. Write a few lines of JavaScript. Then run the script from the prompt.

# Shopping List

- [x]  6 c chicken stock, plus more as needed
- [ ]  2 c polenta
- [ ]  6 oz soft goat cheese, crumbled
- [ ]  1 tsp finely chopped rosemary
- [ ]  2 tbsp butter

# Instructions

1. Bring the stock to a boil in a large, heavy saucepan over high heat. 
2. Whisk in the polenta in a steady stream, then decrease the heat to medium. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, more constantly than you would think possible, until the polenta begins to thicken, approximately 10 minutes.
Keep stirring; otherwise the polenta will boil up.
3. Add the cheese and rosemary and stir for approximately 2 minutes. 
4. Stir in the butter, season with salt and pepper to taste and serve. 

*Note:* It keeps well on the stove, though it thickens as it rests. If it becomes too thick, add chicken stock to thin it out.

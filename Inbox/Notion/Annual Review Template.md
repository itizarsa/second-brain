## üíå Cool Stuff I Discovered this Year

- üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Working with people
    - This was the year where I realised even more that working with other people (a) makes everything more fun, and (b) accelerates results.
    1. Value of a personal trainer 
    2. Value of an assistant 
    3. Social media consultant
    4. YouTube growth coach 
    5. Marketing coach 
    6. Performance coach 
    7. Business coach 
    8. Piano teacher 
    9. Singing teacher online + in-person
    10. Started with guitar teacher in person but lockdown happened again

    12. Joined a business mastermind 
    13. Art teacher 
    14. Tennis lessons 
- üßª Physical Stuff
    1. Face towels 
    2. Water bottle with straw 
    3. Power of having an actually portable laptop (13inch MBP) 
    4. TV - surprisingly nice to have, especially while eating, especially with housemate
    5. PS4 (and later PS5) 
- ‚úçÔ∏è Articles / Blog Posts
    1. Ryan Holiday - [How does it feel to get everything you ever wanted?](https://ryanholiday.net/how-does-it-feel-to-get-everything-you-ever-wanted/?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - It feels like nothing. 
    2. Morgan Housel - [How to read: Lots of Inputs and a Strong Filter](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/how-to-read-lots-of-inputs-and-a-strong-filter/?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - Basically that. 
    3. HBR - [How will you measure your life?](https://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - One line that resonated - ‚Äú**People who are driven to excel have this unconscious propensity to underinvest in their families and overinvest in their careers‚Äîeven though intimate and loving relationships with their families are the most powerful and enduring source of happiness‚Äù**.
    4. [On Caring](http://mindingourway.com/on-caring/?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - 1 - Article - This piece (On Caring) really hit home for me. When it comes to ‚Äòcaring‚Äô about important causes (eg: world poverty. or the suffering of billions of people around the world), I don‚Äôt have much of an internal care-o-meter at all. Even when taking the Giving What We Can pledge (video here), I wondered why I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to 'feel‚Äô anything about the suffering of others. This article made me realise that that‚Äôs okay, and that I can do the right thing anyway.
    5. [The 4 Types of Luck](https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - 2 - Article - This piece about The Four Types of Luck was very interesting. I‚Äôve long felt that 'luck‚Äô as a concept was more nuanced than the simple word suggests, and I found myself nodding along at every point while reading this post.
    6. Tynan - [Dating advice for people in their 30s](https://tynan.com/30s) - 
    7. Jsomers - [Speed Matters](http://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) 
    8. Nat Eliason - 1 - [Article](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/one-year?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - I reread this article by Nat Eliason about Lessons from One Year of Nomadic Passive Income, that I first mentioned on a Monthly Favourites video last year. It holds quite a few valuable lessons beyond simply the benefits and problems he encountered on his year of nomadic passive income.
    9. Article - Although it was written in 2016, [The Court of Values and the Bureau of Boringness](https://meaningness.com/metablog/virtue-court?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is equally apt in 2020 and could easily have been written this year. It‚Äôs a long but thought provoking and entertaining piece that I recommend reading all the way through.
    10. Mr Money Moustache - [The Sweet Spot](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2020/08/04/the-sweet-spot/) - 2 - Article - Mr Money Mustache‚Äôs latest article about The Sweet Spot really resonated with some of the feelings I‚Äôve been grappling with recently. How much money is the sweet spot? How much ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô do we need?
    11. Avoiding hustle traps - 2 - Article - I really enjoyed this post about [Avoiding Hustle Traps](https://boundless.substack.com/p/106-avoiding-hustle-traps-squads?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) from the Boundless newsletter that Paul Millerd writes. Paul featured as a guest on our podcast a few weeks ago, and since that conversation I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about my relationship with work + hustle culture as a whole.
- üéô Podcasts
    - Tim Ferriss x Tony Faddell
        
        2 - Podcast - I enjoyed listening to Tim Ferriss interviewing Tony Fadell, ‚Äúthe father of the iPod‚Äù. Along with lots of interesting stories from the early days of Apple, there were a few interesting takeaways for living a more balanced work + personal life.
        
    - Knowledge Project - Neil Parischa - Happiness, resilience, antidotes to anxiety, morning routines
        
        [https://fs.blog/neil-pasricha/?utm_campaign=Sunday Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue newsletter](https://fs.blog/neil-pasricha/?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)
        
    - Invisibilia - Emotions
        
        1 - Podcast - This episode of Invisibilia titled Emotions was wonderful. I almost exclusively listen to long-form conversational podcasts, so listening to NPR-style podcasts is a pretty novel experience. But apart from that, this episode was amazing - riveting story, emotional rollercoaster, and some very interesting insights for living a more intentional life. It even made me tear up in places.
        
    - Art of Charm - How to talk to strangers
        
        2 - Podcast - This episode of The Art of Charm about how to talk to strangers was a very engaging listen. They discussed the power of being able to connect with strangers, and shared some useful tips and tricks that we can all apply to our lives. Top stuff.
        
    - My First Million - Carey Smith (Big Ass Fans)
        
        4 - Podcast - It‚Äôs been a good week for podcasts. If you‚Äôre interested in business, I‚Äôd thoroughly recommend this episode of the My First Million podcast. It‚Äôs an interview with Carey Smith, the founder of a company called Big Ass Fans that makes big fans for factories.
        
    - Alex Banayan x Rolf Potts
        
        1 - Podcast - [This interview](https://rolfpotts.com/podcast/alex-banayan/?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) between Rolf Potts and Alex Banayan became one of my favourite podcast episodes of all time. If you haven‚Äôt yet, I‚Äôd recommend reading The Third Door, one of my favourite books of 2019, before you listen to this. It‚Äôs incredible.
        
    - Million Dollar brainstorm - Daniel Gross
    - That Creative Life - Hank Green
        
        1 - Podcast - I absolutely *loved* this interview with internet legend Hank Green on the That Creative Life podcast. In fact, here‚Äôs a screenshot of my Roam notes about it.
        
        ![Annual%20Review%20Template%2031e9cb3733ee412a8c1001750c7207a1/Untitled.png](Annual%20Review%20Template%2031e9cb3733ee412a8c1001750c7207a1/Untitled.png)
        
        - If you‚Äôre at all interested in the whole Creator thing, you should definitely follow Sara‚Äôs podcast That Creative Life. I‚Äôve been listening to it since day 1, and very excitingly I was recently featured on it so you might like to check that out too :)
    - Tim Ferriss x Bob Iger
        
        1 - Podcast - I really enjoyed this episode of the Tim Ferriss show where he interviews Bob Iger, who was CEO of the Walt Disney Company for 15 years. Honestly, the phrase that came to mind as I was listening to it was ‚Äúwow, this is delightful‚Äù.
        
    - Art of Charm x Yes Theory
        
        1 - Podcast - I listened to [a fantastic episode from the Art of Charm podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/the-art-of-charm/e/69153491?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) this week (Yes Theory - The Art of Facing Your Fears) which featured an interview with the guys behind the Yes Theory channel on YouTube - one that I absolutely love to watch. They‚Äôre just such a wholesome combination of inspiring, humble and ‚Äònormal‚Äô dudes and this all comes across in this interview - well worth a listen.
        
    - Naval x Samatha Ryan
        
        3 - Podcast - The latest episode of Save Planet, Get Rich on Achieving Happiness featured Naval Ravikant (@naval), a venture capitalist and co-founder of AngelList. Amongst the numerous key takeaways, the one that stuck with me was the idea that the ideal life would be one where you had a hobby that as a byproduct made you money, a hobby that as a byproduct kept you healthy and a hobby that as a byproduct made you smarter and more creative.
        
- üìö Books
    1. Wheel of Time series. Started in 2019, finished mid 2020.
    2. Six of Crows - 2 - Book - I‚Äôve started listening to Six of Crows, a fantasy series by Leigh Bardugo. So far, it‚Äôs incredible and it‚Äôs filling the hole in my heart from when I finished the Wheel of Time series a few weeks ago.
    3. Elantris
    4. How to take smart notes 
    5. [Normal people](https://geni.us/PHu4OKo) - 2 - Book - I managed to read Normal People in basically one sitting last Monday. I started at 11pm at work after a recommendation from a friend, read for an hour until midnight, drove home, arrived back at 00:40, changed and brushed my teeth, got into bed at 1am and read non stop until 4:15 when I finished the book with a tear in my eye. I also heard it‚Äôs just become a TV series on the BBC but the book is superb.
    6. [A Million Miles in a Thousand Years](https://geni.us/7P0KAAM) - 3 - Book - Another book that made me cry this week is A Million Miles in a Thousand Year by Donald Miller. It‚Äôs really made me reconsider my life and think more deeply about the choices I make. I‚Äôd highly recommend everyone reads it.
    7. [Storyworthy](https://geni.us/5OpIUA?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - 3 - Book - I started reading ‚ÄôStoryworthy‚Äô by Matthew Dicks this week (where the Homework for Life stuff came from). It‚Äôs one of the most engaging books I‚Äôve ever read and has already changed my outlook on the stories that happen every single day in our lives that usually just pass us by.
    8. [How to think more about Sex](https://geni.us/alainsex?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - Alain de Botton - 4 - Book - I listened to the entirety of Alain de Botton‚Äôs fantastic book How to Think More About Sex on Audible over two car journeys. It should be required reading for everyone.
    9. [Natives by Akala](https://geni.us/natives?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - 2 - Book - On my friend Naed‚Äôs recommendation I picked up and absolutely loved Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire by Akala, narrated by the author himself, on Audible. I must be getting soft because I teared up in plenty of places in this too. It‚Äôs probably the book that‚Äôs most changed my view of the world in the last few years.
    10. [The Ride of Lifetime](https://geni.us/Iv2jQyX?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - 1 - Book - I raced through The Ride of a Lifetime written by the former CEO of The Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger in which he shares the lessons he learned while running Disney for 15 years. It‚Äôs an incredible book and made me tear up at times - 10/10, would definitely recommend to anyone.
    11. [The Elephant in the Brain](https://geni.us/elephante?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - Book - I‚Äôve just finished The Elephant in the Brain, an incredible book about the hidden motives in everyday life. It led to many uncomfortable realisations of just how much of human behaviour generally (and my own behaviour specifically) is motivated by selfishness, status and prestige.
    12. [War Doctor](https://geni.us/0AHD?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - 1. Book - I raced through War Doctor this week which is an inspiring medical memoir by David Nott, a UK trauma surgeon who, for the past 25 years, has volunteered in some of the most dangerous warzones around the world. It‚Äôs both inspiring and emotional and gives an insight into the world of humanitarian medicine.
- üé¨ YouTube Channels / Videos
    1. [Binging with Babish](https://www.youtube.com/user/bgfilms)
    2. [Yes Theory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvK4bOhULCpmLabd2pDMtnA) - YouTube Channel (Yes Theory) - I‚Äôd been seeing these guys‚Äô videos recommended for a few years, but never really taken the time to get into them. That changed this week, and I‚Äôve spent hours watching them and being inspired to seek discomfort and to be more bold and adventurous. Can‚Äôt recommend them highly enough.
    3. [One day more viral parody](https://youtu.be/Nf4XxnL4lPk?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - You might‚Äôve already seen this viral parody of One Day More from Les Miserables done by a British family. It‚Äôs one of the best things I‚Äôve seen all year.
    4. Tom Scott's "[This video has X views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Sunday%20Snippets&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=BxV14h0kFs0)" - Another absolutely delightful (it‚Äôs the only word to describe it) video that I watched this week was Tom Scott‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis video has 6,857,449 views‚Äù. I‚Äôd highly recommend watching all of it through to the end. I genuinely teared up at the ending.
    5. The Making of Galway Girl - We never usually get to see how an internationally renowned song is put together but this video documenting the creation of Ed Sheeran‚Äôs Galway Girl is fascinating and inspiring.

## üí≠ Reflective Questions

- What were the 'difficult' things this year? Any challenges?
    1. Getting over the fear of selling and whacking together the PTYA within a few weeks. 
    2. Workout-related stuff. Pushing through during workout sessions with PT. 
- When have you felt proud of yourself in 2020? what were you doing?
    
    I don't often feel 'proud' of myself. What does that feeling even mean? 
    
- If you had to teach one thing you learnt this year (that would improve one‚Äôs quality of life) what would that be?
    
    The power of accountability. I've hired lots of coaches this year, for various things. Most of their value comes from making the space to discuss something with someone for an extended period of time. Eg: when it comes to my performance coach, most of the value in the sessions with him is just in the fact that we're talking about my life, and he's asking probing questions for an hour every 2 weeks. 
    
    For people who have money, coaches are a total no-brainer. For people who don't have money, you can probably get a similar value-add out of getting together with a dedicated friend once a week to talk through your struggles and challenges that week. 
    
- What kept you up at night with excitement this year? Was it worth it? Would you want to do more of it?
    
    Two, both of which were work-related. 
    
    1 - **Part-Time YouTuber Academy**. From idea to execution it was just a few weeks, but in that time, I had lots of phone calls with people who run cohort-based courses, and became really excited by the possibility of making this one really great. At times I'd stay up planning lessons in my head, trying to make it as good as possible. At other times, I'd stay up thinking about the ecosystem of products that we could create around the Academy. This was super fun. Probably not good to stay awake with excitement in general, but it was nice in small doses. 
    
    2 - **Team-based stuff** - Through reading books like *The Making of a Manager* and *Who Not How,* I got excited by the idea of systemising and processifying various business stuff. Imagining handing off project management of various things to team members made me realise that the business can grow and thrive without that growth being necessarily tied to me giving up more of my time. 
    
- How did you have fun differently in 2020?
    
    I bought a PS4 a few weeks into lockdown, and later a PS5 when it came out. I realised that playing video games is quite fun, although not as fulfilling as doing other things like music, working on the business etc. 
    
    I realised the incredible power of listening to audiobooks while playing playstation. This felt like peak pleasure stacking - playing Demons Souls on PS5 while listening to *Rhythm of War* by Brandon Sanderson. 
    
    I also discovered, for the first time this year, the power of listening to audiobooks at speed multiples. Since 2017, I've been listening to fantasy audiobooks, but always at 1x speed. By switching it up to 1.5 - 2.5x speed, I got through a load of books a lot faster, and didn't enjoy them any less. 
    
    Listening at 2.5x speed helped me get through the slower books in the *Wheel of Time* series. When things started to get epic, I'd switch to 1.5x. I think this is how I'll enjoy audiobooks from now on. 
    
- How did you suffer differently in 2020?
    
    It would be hard to call this 'suffering'. But I suppose, 2020 was the first time I really experienced working with a hostile colleague. It was one of the senior doctors at work who I didn't have a great relationship with. We got off on the wrong foot, and I got the impression that he thought of me as being incompetent / a fraud in various ways. Therefore, he'd take a critical eye to almost everything I'd do, and I'd have a sense of anxiety when asking him about patients I'd seen. The other senior doctors were a lot nicer to work with - even when giving critical feedback, they'd do it in a 'nice' way that didn't make me feel awful. 
    
    It feels very strange to write this, because I really don't want to give the impression (or even internally think) that he was "out to get me". There are a dozen other ways of framing the situation. Most likely, he was just a no-bs sort of person, who believed in speaking directly rather than mincing his words. This, combined with a more-prone-to-stress attitude meant that some of his juniors would feel scared / anxious about asking him things. In reality, it was probably nothing to do with me directly. 
    
- What people/kind of people did you spend less time with in 2020?
    
    Covid put a stop to a lot of travelling-themed interactions. So I didn't hang out with many friends who live outside of Cambridge, for example. 
    
- What people/kind of people did you spend more time with in 2020?
    
    More time with team members. 
    
    More time with housemate, especially after I stopped working as a doctor. 
    
    I had a lot of fan meetups when lockdown wasn't a thing. Those were always quite fun. It's nice stationing myself in a coffee shop for one afternoon a week and whoever wants to hang out and come over and hang out. Would be even better if there were an area that had a big table that we could commandeer, because the coffee shop often felt cramped, but I guess that's a vibe. 
    
- What did you feel guilty for in 2020?
    
    Partly I felt 'guilty' when I wanted to do my own thing rather than hang out with others. I went on holiday with a friend, and I wanted it to be a mostly working vacation where I'm sitting on my laptop all day. But I suspected that my friend wanted to spend more time 'together'. I felt a bit guilty about this because their expectations were clearly different to mine, and I was concerned that they were less happy on the vacation because of it. 
    
    I wonder if I *should* feel guilty about taking a break from Medicine during COVID. I don't in the slightest. 
    
- What 3 people are you the most grateful to in 2020 and why? How can you thank them? How can you find more people like this in your life?
- What new habits did you create in 2020? Which ones would you want to keep?
    1. Power Hour - definitely keep 
    2. Recently started working on a long-term project for 15 minutes per day. I'd like to keep that up. 
    3. Tennis lessons starting soon
    4. Need to get more systematic with singing lessons and singing practise 
    5. Personal trainer 
- Did you feel you spent enough time with your family/significant other in 2020? How would you change this in 2021?
    
    Yeah. 
    
- What things did you stop caring about in 2020?
    
    When it comes to relationships (particularly romantic ones), I used to be concerned that I wasn't much of a multi-player kinda guy. In that, my ideal relationship (I think) would be one where we did our own thing 90% of the time, and hung out / did stuff together 10% of the time. I've become more accepting of this as a facet of my personality, and *really* can't imagine being with someone who I'd feel so strongly about so as to want to spend proportionally more time with them. 
    
    To some extent, I wonder if this is (a) a failure of imagination on my part, or (b) if it's just that I haven't met 'the right person' with whom I'd happily spend large amounts of time with doing stuff together. But realistically, I think in large part, this is 'just who I am'. And therefore, even if I met someone who I felt super strongly about (initially), I imagine we'd still end up in the situation where we're doing our own thing 90% of the time, and hanging out 10% of the time. I guess this is something useful to know about myself, so that potential romantic prospects know what they're getting into. 
    
    I've run this theory past a few female friends. Some of them said "yeah that makes sense, I've got / would like that kinda vibe with my partner anyway". Others have said "I can't imagine being happy in a relationship where that's the dynamic". Which makes sense. 
    
    So given that the question is 'what things did you stop caring about in 2020', I guess my answer is that I've stopped 'caring' about whether it's 'weird' for me to be a mostly single-player kinda guy. It is what it is :) 
    
- What new thing did you spend a lot of money on in 2020?
    
    I want to say takeaway, but that's not true - I've spent large amounts of money on takeaway for the past several years. 
    
    The biggest expense in my life this year has definitely been various coaches, consultants and trainers. This has been game-changing. 
    
- What new thing did you spend a lot of time on in 2020?
    
    Watching TV. Unsurprisingly, as soon as my housemate and I got a TV, we started watching more TV. We now watch an episode of something like *Schitt's Creek* with lunch, and often another with dinner. We'll even occasionally watch random movies. She likes to have them on in the background while doing work, which is obviously suboptimal and distracting, but it works for her. And on days where I'm half-arsing work anyway, I tell myself 'it's fine, I'll just semi work and semi watch Harry Potter in the background'. Inevitably, I end up just watching the film and screwing work. This isn't really bad... if I *actually* wanted to get work done, I'd just do it. But the TV is one of those distracting influences that probably reveals what I actually want. 
    
- What do you feel you‚Äôve gotten a lot better at in 2020?
    
    Work - delegating.
    
- What did you rediscover pleasure in in 2020?
    
    Gaming.
    
- When you felt at peace this year, what were you doing?
    
    Listening to an audiobook.
    
- Which of last years goals did you not achieve? Why did you not achieve them? Will you carry them on to 2021 and if not why?
    
    I made some headway on health and posture, but not much. 
    
    Didn't make headway at all on the cooking front. Realised that it's not a big priority right now. 
    
    Didn't make headway at all on the learning to draw front, but I wasn't really serious about it. 
    
    Made some progress on singing, but the issue was lack of regularity and lack of regular practise regimen. Solution - advance booking lessons with Adam + ensuring practise. 
    
    Dating - Intended to take this more seriously. Pandemic was an issue. 
    
    Travel - Pandemic was an issue. 
    
- At the end of next year, if you are drastically exceeding your expectations, what would you be doing?

# üéØ Step 2 - Plan

- Visualisation Exercises
    - Ideal Ordinary Week - 5 Years from Now
    - Ideal Ordinary Week - Next Year
    1. Describe a day
    2. Describe how you feel 
    3. Describe what you're doing, what you're working on etc. 
    4. The more specific you can be in describing these, you can note the differences with what you're not doing, but more importantly, the things that don't show up that you're doing right now. 
        1. Biggest thing that people blow is "the same but more". We're doing awesome, let's just do a little more of that. Instead of 1 video a week, we're doing 2 videos a week. 
        2. Most important thing to come out of a vision are what are the things that are going to stop? What are the things that are no longer a priority?

## üçÄ Life

- 2019
    1. Consistent gym - There were periods off time where I had a pretty good routine going, but it was during things like holidays and night shifts that 
    2. Cooking - 
    3. Storytelling - Real life + online (Tynan, Superhuman Social Skills) 
    4. Dating - This was the first year that I'd actively made a bit of effort on the dating front. Last year I dabbled with it a little, but mostly coasted by with people that I already knew. Next year, I'd like to put some more time into this - it's far too easy to think 'ah I'm busy I can't be bothered with this' but it's 

**Health** 

- 3/week workout plan with trainer, maybe with Scott? But I like the vibe of Dan doing sessions, that'll be great for accountability especially when I'm abroad.
- Regular tennis lessons
- Join a squash club for when in Cambridge
- Would be nice to have a daily mobility / stretching etc routine to help fix posture long-term

**Relationships**

- Take dating etc more seriously (post lockdown)
    - Maybe get a dating coach? Might be interesting. Might even make for a good video.
- More intentional keeping in touch with friends - the calendly link situation seems pretty solid for now, we'll see how that goes for a few weeks.

**Happiness**

- Hard to imagine this going up, but there are probably lots of unknown unknowns
- Worth experimenting with meditation
- Would be nice to try psychedelics at some point
- Would be interesting to get a therapist to see what happens + might make for a good video

## üíâ Medicine

- I'd like to dabble in some emergency medicine - would be nice to do 1-2 shifts per week in Jan + Feb before the European travel adventure.
- I wonder if I should apply to something in Nov 2021? Maybe ACCS in London? I think whatever happens, it's worth applying, and then I can see how I feel after the interviews etc.

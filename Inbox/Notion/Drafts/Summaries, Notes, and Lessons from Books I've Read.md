Most of the important things I’ve learned have come from books, articles, speeches, and other media. After seeing how [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) publicizes his book notes, I decided I would publicize all of my summaries and notes from books, speeches, articles, and other things I was reading.

**To get the notes, click on any linked title**. I included short snippets and ratings to give you an idea of what you might find interesting. I’ve roughly categorized it by topic, some of these are broad, some are narrow, it’ll change with time.

The notes and summaries are meant to be concise, reminding me of high-level concepts and not trying to recreate the whole book. You can use them to remind yourself of something you read or to decide on something new to read.

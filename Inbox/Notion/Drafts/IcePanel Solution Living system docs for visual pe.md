### Structured diagramming

IcePanel uses the C4 model standard providing a structured approach to easily communicate architectures, allowing you to zoom in and out of different levels of detail.

Your model keeps your diagram objects in sync from anywhere, creating consistent, up-to-date diagrams with minimal effort!

### Documentation you can trust

The Trust Score™ indicates how valid and maintained your system docs are. Keep trust 100%!

With IcePanel’s GitHub integration, you can link directly to your repos, folders and files. We periodically check the existence of the linked resource, which we factor into your trust score.

### Diagrams and Docs in one place

Our side-by-side diagram and documentation removes the pain of constantly re-exporting and importing into other tools.

No more …Design_Final_V7_Final_I_Promise.vsdx files that create chaos and confusion. Always share the latest version to save time and reduce miscommunication.

### Share with the whole team

Diagrams-as-code tools often create access barriers, preventing everyone in your team from understanding your system.

Easily get your whole team exploring your system design in a tool that everyone can access and understand. IcePanel also has password protected links, when you are sharing sensitive data.

Not understanding what decisions were made in the past, and why causes confusion and countless time-wasting questions.

Time travel through the evolution of your system design from its initial state to its current iteration with the version timeline.

### Visualise variants with tags

Colours without a key make it harder for your colleagues to understand your diagrams without asking questions.

With tag groups, give your colours meaning and effortlessly show different perspectives without creating duplicate diagrams.

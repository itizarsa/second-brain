Below is a loosely-categorized collection of links to CS textbooks in a variety of areas that are freely available online, usually because they are one of the following:

- An open textbook (such as PLAI, SF, or the HoTT book)
- An older book that is out of print, for which the copyright has returned to the original author(s) (such as TTFP)
- An author’s own preprint or draft of a textbook. This includes cases where the author has made special arrangements with a publisher to host an electronic copy of a published text on their homepage while it remains in print.

I also include below a list of papers I consider good stand-alone introductions to certain topics, and a list of links to thorough special topics courses.

If you find one of the links below is broken or has moved, feel free to let me know.

Those with time to spare and looking to have less of it may enjoy browsing the QA call numbers in [UPenn’s extensive listing of online books](http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/). Most of those listed here were found independently over the years, but I’ve just now (June 2020) learned of this excellent repository of links. I’ll add to the links below as I find promising books.

Key:

- + = A book I have spent considerable time with and highly recommend.
- No prefix: a book I’ve perused casually, and looks good, but I have not (yet) spent much time with.

    - This one’s a bit awkward to find: Click on the “Resources” tab (right of Description and Contents), and in the resulting “General Resources” side-bar that appears to the left, click on the book title. In the table that appears, click where the book title appears under the “Name” column; this is the full PDF of the book.

## Introductions to Programming and/or Computer Science

Some of the books listed in other categories are appropriate for someone looking to get started with programming and/or computer science. I’ve duplicated those links in this section so they’re easier to find if that’s what you need.

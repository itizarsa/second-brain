This website is a single HTML file. It simply uses the `#anchor` suffix (from [1992](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html)) and the `:target` CSS selector to show and hide pages/content.

This setup1 is databaseless, javascriptless, and buildshit-free, so you can edit your website with a text editor and upload it somewhere2 like a normal person.

## Do it yourself:

1. Download `[index.html](https://john-doe.neocities.org/dist/index.html)` and `[style.css](https://john-doe.neocities.org/dist/style.css)`
2. Add a `<section>` with an `id` to define a new page in `index.html` <section id="contact"> Contact me! </section>
3. And [if you want](https://john-doe.neocities.org/), a link to it inside `<nav>`

## Getting started

- **Interactive usage**
    - git-quick-stats has a built-in interactive menu that can be executed as such:  `git-quick-stats`  Or  `git quick-stats`
- **Non-interactive usage**
    - For those who prefer to utilize command-line options, git-quick-stats also has a non-interactive mode supporting both short and long options:  `git-quick-stats [optional-command-to-execute-directly]`  Or  `git quick-stats [optional-command-to-execute-directly]`
    - Command-line arguments:  `r, --suggest-reviewers` show the best people to contact to review code `T, --detailed-git-stats` - give a detailed list of git stats `R, --git-stats-by-branch` see detailed list of git stats by branch `d, --commits-per-day` displays a list of commits per day `m, --commits-by-month` displays a list of commits per month `w, --commits-by-weekday` displays a list of commits per weekday `o, --commits-by-hour` displays a list of commits per hour `A, --commits-by-author-by-hour` displays a list of commits per hour by author `a, --commits-per-author` displays a list of commits per author `S, --my-daily-stats` see your current daily stats `C, --contributors` see a list of everyone who contributed to the repo `b, --branch-tree` show an ASCII graph of the git repo branch history `D, --branches-by-date` show branches by date `c, --changelogs` see changelogs `L, --changelogs-by-author` see changelogs by author `j, --json-output` save git log as a JSON formatted file to a specified area `h, -?, --help` display this help text in the terminal

## Documentation

- **Git log since and until**   `export _GIT_UNTIL="2017-01-22"`
    
    You can set the variables _GIT_SINCE and/or _GIT_UNTIL before running git-quick-stats to limit the git log.  These work similar to git's built-in --since and --until log options.
    
    Once set, run git quick-stats as normal. Note that this affects all stats that parse the git log history until unset.
    
- **Git log limit**
    
    You can set variable _GIT_LIMIT for limited output. It will affect the "changelogs" and "branch tree" options.
    
                                        `export _GIT_LIMIT=20`
                                    
    
- **Git pathspec**   `export _GIT_PATHSPEC=':!directory'`
    
    You can exclude a directory from the stats by using pathspec
    
    You can also exclude files from the stats. Note that it works with any alphanumeric, glob, or regex that git respects.
    
                                        `export _GIT_PATHSPEC=':!package-lock.json'`
                                    
    
- **Git merge view strategy**
    
    You can set the variable _GIT_MERGE_VIEW to enable merge commits to be part of the stats by setting _GIT_MERGE_VIEW to enable. You can also choose to only show merge commits by setting _GIT_MERGE_VIEW to exclusive. Default is to not show merge commits. These work similar to git's built-in --merges and --no-merges log options.
    
                                        `export _GIT_MERGE_VIEW="enable"
                                        export _GIT_MERGE_VIEW="exclusive"`
                                    
    
- **Color themes**
    
    You can change to the legacy color scheme by toggling the variable _MENU_THEME between default and legacy
    
                                        `export _MENU_THEME=legacy`

### Are you sick of wasting days writing proposals that donâ€™t close?

- Do you get writers block when you try to write proposals?
- Do you spend days working on proposals that ultimately donâ€™t turn into business?
- Do you fear leaving money on the table with low prices?
- Are you unsure how or when to follow up after sending your proposals?
- Is your close rate lower than 80%?

### Imagine writing killer proposals in under an hour

- Imagine knowing exactly what words to use when writing a proposal.
- Imagine cranking out effective proposals in a fraction of the time.
- Imagine knowing that you priced your work right.
- Imagine knowing exactly how long to wait and what to say when following-up.
- Imagine closing 80% or more of your proposals.

### My FREE 5-Page Proposal Template is the answer

My FREE 5-Page Proposal Template will show you how to write proposals in a fraction of the time, increase your close rate, and stop leaving money on the table. As a consultant, **I have closed well over seven-figures of business with this exact template.**

**What youâ€™ll learn:**

- How to structure the proposal
- How many options to provide
- Why to focus on benefits, not deliverables
- How to anchor your prices to the outcome, not your hours
- What pricing terms to include
- What to negotiate - and what NOT to negotiate!

## What people are saying

Hereâ€™s what people have to say about my FREE 5-page proposal template:

> @jonathanstark Just used your proposal template for the 1st time. Landed our larget client ever. So thankful for your talk at #dyfconf
> 

> I used Jonathanâ€™s retainer template to land a support and mentoring contract. The client got peace of mind and the assistance they needed, and I got an effective hourly rate of close to $1,000!
> 

> Jonathan - I used your proposal as a template for a job I pitched yesterday. They LOVED it. Not only did they love it, they picked option 3 (the highest priced option) and want to put me on retainer after the final project payment. And as you suggested, I asked for 50%/50% with a set final payment date and they agreed - itâ€™s freaking brilliant! Because of your instruction this month, I had the balls to ask, and the client didnâ€™t bat an eye. I never thought about fixed date before but will never do it another way. Thanks!
> 

> Jonathan gave me a blueprint of exactly how to lay out a proposal, step by step, follow the numbers. Having this blueprint means now when I create a proposal I just have to follow the plan, check the boxes and Iâ€™m done. (Ok it takes a little more effort but thatâ€™s how easy Jonathan has made it now).
> 

> Hey Jonathan - Just today I closed a new client, the first one where I borrowed a few pages from your playbook to get the initial engagement. I pitched a short â€˜Tech Assessmentâ€™ for $3K, due %100 up-front. I actually used your proposal template, including the de-risking guarantee. They read the proposal and just responded asking how they can wire the funds, as sending a check will take too long. ZERO pushback :) Granted, its a small initial project, BUT these guys are a canonical example of my target ideal client, so Iâ€™m very pleased. Thanks for your continued inspiration and excellent guidance! Keep on, brother!! â€“ Terry Bissonnette

> Jonathan, I read all your posts in one sitting, and the proposal. Pure genius. Thanks for the insights.

## About Jonathan

Hi! Iâ€™m Jonathan Stark and was a software consultant for the better part of fifteen years. Iâ€™ve given sold out talks on three continents, I am the author of five books, and I have helped brands like Staples, Time, T-Mobile, and others with their software strategy, tactics, and training. *(You can check out my [press page](https://jonathanstark.com/press) for more info.)*

In my first year as a solo consultant, I doubled my income by ditching hourly billing for value pricing. I have over a decade of real-world experience successfully applying value-based theories to my own consulting work and that of 100+ business owners I have counseled. **These days I routinely command an effective hourly rate of $2000+ per hour.**

The unconscious acceptance of hourly billing as the best and only option for selling services is a collective hallucination that literally keeps me up at night. In fact, **I consider it my mission in life to rid the earth of hourly billing.** Care to join me? Youâ€™ll be glad you did. ðŸ™‚

Appsmith is an [open source](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith) framework to build admin panels, CRUD apps and workflows. Build everything you need, 10x faster.

I used to use terminal and Postman to run queries for sales demos. I replaced it with Appsmith. It took me an hour to create an app that connects to Hubspot and a Postgres instance.

The internal tools that I built with Appsmith have been critical in helping customer support agents resolve issues faster, & get access to critical data instantly without having to wait on developers.

Our support team was depending on multiple tools to get all customer information. Arpit helped me build a single customer view tool that talked to Freshdesk, Fullstory, Chargebee, and Stripe. In 45 mins!

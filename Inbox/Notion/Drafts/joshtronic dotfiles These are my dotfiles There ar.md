# [joshtronic](https://joshtronic.com/) does `dotfiles`

These are my `dotfiles`. There are many like them, but these are mine. My `dotfiles` are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my life. My `dotfiles`, without me, are useless. Without my `dotfiles`, I am useless.

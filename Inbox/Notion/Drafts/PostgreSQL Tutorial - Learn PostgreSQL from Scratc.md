## Basic PostgreSQL Tutorial

First, you’ll learn how to query data from a single table using basic data querying techniques, including selecting data, sorting result sets, and filtering rows. Then, you’ll learn about advanced queries such as joining multiple tables, using set operations, and constructing the subquery. Finally, you will learn how to manage database tables, such as creating a new table or modifying an existing table’s structure.

### Section 1. Querying Data

- [Select](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-select/) – show you how to query data from a single table.
- [Column aliases](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-column-alias/) – learn how to assign temporary names to columns or expressions in a query.
- [Order By](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-order-by/) – guide you on how to sort the result set returned from a query.
- [Select Distinct](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-select-distinct/)  – provide you a clause that removes duplicate rows in the result set.

### Section 2. Filtering Data

- [Where](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-where/) – filter rows based on a specified condition.
- [Limit](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-limit/) – get a subset of rows generated by a query.
- [Fetch](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-fetch/)– limit the number of rows returned by a query.
- [In](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-in/) – select data that matches any value in a list of values.
- [Between](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-between/) – select data that is a range of values.
- [Like](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-like/) – filter data based on pattern matching.
- [Is Null](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-is-null/) – check if a value is null or not.

### Section 3. Joining Multiple Tables

- [Joins](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-joins/) – show you a brief overview of joins in PostgreSQL.
- [Table aliases](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-alias/) – describes how to use table aliases in the query.
- [Inner Join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-inner-join/) – select rows from one table that has the corresponding rows in other tables.
- [Left Join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-left-join/) – select rows from one table that may or may not have the corresponding rows in other tables.
- [Self-join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-self-join/) – join a table to itself by comparing a table to itself.
- [Full Outer Join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-full-outer-join/) – use the full join to find a row in a table that does not have a matching row in another table.
- [Cross Join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-cross-join/) – produce a Cartesian product of the rows in two or more tables.
- [Natural Join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-natural-join/) – join two or more tables using implicit join condition based on the common column names in the joined tables.

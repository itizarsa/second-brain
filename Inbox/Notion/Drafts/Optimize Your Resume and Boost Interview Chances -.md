## Beat the bots

Most companies, including 99% of Fortune 500, use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to process your resume. These systems cause qualified candidates like you to slip through the cracks.

Jobscan reverse-engineered all the top ATS and studied recruiter workflows to get you in the “yes” pile.

**What is resume optimization?**

Resume optimization is the process of tailoring your resume each time you apply for a job based on the job description and recruiting software. The two major tenets of resume optimization are identifying the most critical skills in the job description and naturally including them on your resume, and formatting your resume in a way that avoids parsing errors and display issues within applicant tracking systems (ATS).

**Why do I need to tailor my resume for every job?**

Tailoring your resume based on exactly what was written into the job description will ensure that you’re checking every box and proving that you’re ready to adapt to the unique needs of the company. A general resume will only tell half of the story. Here’s a real-life example: A job seeker applied to 300 jobs without getting a single response. Once they found Jobscan and began tailoring their resume, [their next 8 applications resulted in 5 job interviews.](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/)

**What if I need to create a new resume?**

If you’re creating a resume for the first time, haven’t updated your resume in several years, or just want to start from scratch, Jobscan’s free resume builder is what you need. The resume builder makes it easy. Just pick an ATS-friendly template, follow the prompts, and export a new resume that is compatible with any online job application. This is a great way to create a general resume that you optimize for each new job opportunity.

**How can I tailor my resume faster?**

The fastest way to tailor your resume is by using Power Edit, Jobscan’s real-time resume editor. Power Edit imports your resume and makes it editable right on the website. As you make changes to your resume, the skill, keyword, and formatting checks update dynamically and show you the next most important optimization. When you’re done tailoring your resume, download it as an ATS-friendly document.

**How do I beat Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)?**

You don’t need shady tricks to “beat” an ATS because an ATS won’t be rejecting your resume. There are real recruiters using the ATS software who make the decision to reject or approve an applicant like you.

Through resume optimization, you can significantly increase your visibility and interview chances by applying with a resume that is ATS-friendly, or written to be compatible with the way real recruiters use these systems. This includes sticking to formatting guidelines that ensure your resume will display as intended within a digital profile and targeting your resume keywords based on what the recruiter is looking for.

It’s true that ATS have search, filter, and ranking features that recruiters can use. For example, Taleo, one of the most-used ATS in the United States, has a feature called ReqRank that automatically compares applicants’ resumes to the job description and ranks them based on match rate. In theory, tools like this would save recruiters time and help them focus on top candidates. In reality, these algorithms are unreliable and most recruiters still manually review as many resumes as they can. The idea that ATS “robots” are auto-rejecting thousands of applicants without human input is a myth. The common claim that “75% of applicants are rejected by ATS” is simply not true.

That said, most job seekers do not apply with resumes optimized for the way recruiters use ATS and don’t get the consideration they expect as a result. If you’re here, you’re on the right track.

**Can I optimize my LinkedIn profile as well?**

Optimized skills and keywords are just as critical on your LinkedIn profile. Recruiters source candidates from LinkedIn every day using search tools to find people with the right experience, hard skills, and qualifications. LinkedIn optimization differs from resume optimization because instead of tailoring to one specific job description, you must optimize for more job types within your industry.

With Jobscan LinkedIn Optimization, you can optimize your LinkedIn profile based on three or more job descriptions. Optimizing your LinkedIn profile results in 3x more search appearances.

**Do cover letters need to be optimized?**

An optimized cover letter can help increase your application’s visibility. If a recruiter searches their ATS for certain skills and keywords, your cover letter content will help you rank as a top search result. Optimizing your cover letter based on job description keywords also helps you target your message and prove that you’re focusing on the most important aspects of the job. Jobscan’s cover letter optimization tool checks your letter for keywords, tone, best formatting practices, and more.

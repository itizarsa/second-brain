## Frequently Asked Questions

The Mastermind tier provides the best value but if you are serious about taking your career to a new level, consider investing into [Expert Mentorship](https://node.university/p/premium-membership).

Yes. This service will have (and maybe already has) front-end materials as well as courses on HTML, CSS, Computer Science and more! You can submit your requests to new content.

No. This is not a real brick and mortar university like Stanford or Harvard. Node.U is an online school and we don't issue diplomas at this time.

The course starts now and never ends! It is a completely self-paced online course - you decide when you start and when you finish. That's the benefit of online coursesâ€”you learn at your OWN pace. You don't have to watch a lecture if it has already familiar to you material. Just skip it or play on 2x. You can rewind/replay other videos which you didn't quite grasp the first time. Try doing it in a live class!

How long do I have access to the course?

If this is a premium membership course, you will have access to it as long as you are member. If it's a free course, then you will have access as long as Node University is around.

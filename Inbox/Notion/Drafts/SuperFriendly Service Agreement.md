Doing business doesn’t have to be confusing or complicated.

If you’re thinking about working with SuperFriendly, here’s our simple, standard Service Agreement that you can browse through to get a sense of how we like to work. If you’re an agency or freelancer and aren’t happy with yours—or worse, you don’t use any type of contract—you’re welcome to use ours as a starting point. [*](http://agreement.superfriend.ly/)

Contains `.docx`, `.pages`, `.key`, and `.html` formats.

By downloading this Service Agreement, you agree to abide by our [Terms](http://agreement.superfriend.ly/terms/).

We wrote this agreement from scratch with our lawyer, Matt Sherlock, to fit our specific project needs and our customers’ needs. While you’re free to use this as-is, there’s no substitute for drafting your own agreements.

If you don’t have a lawyer of your own, Matt would be glad to help you out. Drop him a line at **matthew.sherlock [at] gmail [dot] com**.

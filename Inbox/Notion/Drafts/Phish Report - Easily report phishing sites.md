## How it works

Phish.Report is the quickest and easiest way to report phishing sites and actually get them taken down. Phish.Report brings all the relevant abuse report forms into a single page and automates the process as much as possible.

When you enter a URL, Phish.Report:

1. Looks up the domain registrar and hosting provider from WHOIS records
2. Matches these details against its [abuse contact details database](https://phish.report/contacts/)
3. Gives you an interactive checklist for reporting the site

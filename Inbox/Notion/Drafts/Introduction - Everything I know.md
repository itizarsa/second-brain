This is my personal wiki where I share [everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/everything-i-know) about this world in form of an [online GitBook](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look [here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/meta) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals.

Aside from this wiki, I am using [Dendron](https://dendron.so/) to grow a [more powerful version of my digital second brain](https://epictools.dev/). And build [Learn Anything](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/ideas/learn-anything).

Such wikis are also called [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.

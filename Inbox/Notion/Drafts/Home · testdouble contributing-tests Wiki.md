This wiki presents some notes on testing.

It's still very much a work-in-progress, so feel free to peruse any pages that interest you. Perhaps the most novel aspect to this repo right now is the discussion of the [trade-off between regression safety in testing and design](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Tests%27-Influence-on-Design). There will also be a discussion of [Detroit-school](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Detroit-school-TDD) and [London-school](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/London-school-TDD) TDD, as that isn't well articulated on the Internet, as far as I know.

This wiki has been a long time coming to help short-circuit conversations about concepts core to software testing that I'm tired of repeating. The first catalyst to actually working on it has been a [5-day training](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/5-Day-Training-Agenda) event. In the fall of 2015, it'll support the development of [this talk](https://gist.github.com/searls/19f34ef932124702cfa1) at a handful of conferences across the US.

Because the articles in this wiki constitute both explanation and advice, they will occasionally slip into first-person speech. At the present time, the only author is [Justin Searls](http://twitter.com/searls), so any references to "Me", "I", etc., refer to him. If, down the road, others contribute to this wiki, then first-person voice should be read as a consensus of their opinions unless otherwise noted.

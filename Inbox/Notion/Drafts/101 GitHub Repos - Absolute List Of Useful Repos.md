This is a list that I compiled over the years, it contains everything I found to be useful or interesting.

There is no special categorization, it flows a bit to JS side but there little bit of everything.

Please feel free to comment and add your favorite repos.

Here is the list in no particular order:

#1 [github1s](https://github.com/conwnet/github1s)
Fresh out of the Owen, One second to read GitHub code with VS Code.

#2 [Rough.js](https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough)

#3 [Sonic](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic)
Sonic is a fast, lightweight and schema-less search backend. It ingests search texts and identifier tuples that can then be queried against in a microsecond's time.

#4 [ciao](https://github.com/brotandgames/ciao)

It uses Cron syntax to schedule the checks and comes along with a Web UI and a RESTful JSON API.

#5 [Browser Preview for VS Code](https://github.com/auchenberg/vscode-browser-preview)
Browser Preview for VS Code enables you to open a real browser preview inside your editor that you can debug. Browser Preview is powered by Chrome Headless, and works by starting a headless Chrome instance in a new process. This enables a secure way to render web content inside VS Code, and enables interesting features such as in-editor debugging and more!

#6 [Hoppscotch](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch) 
A free, fast and beautiful API request builder Helps you create requests faster, saving precious time on development

#7 [The V Programming Language](https://github.com/vlang/v)

#9 [Chatwoot](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot) 
Chatwoot is an open-source omnichannel customer support software. The development of Chatwoot started in 2016. It failed to succeed as a business and eventually shut up shop in 2017. During 2019 #Hacktoberfest, the maintainers decided to make it open-source, instead of letting the code rust in a private repo. With a pleasant surprise, Chatwoot became a trending project on Hacker News and best of all, got lots of love from the community. Now, a failed project is back on track and the prospects are looking great. The team is back to working on the project and this time, we are building it in the open. Thanks to the ideas and contributions from the community.

#10 [Flan Scan](https://github.com/cloudflare/flan)
Flan Scan is a lightweight network vulnerability scanner. With Flan Scan you can easily find open ports on your network, identify services and their version, and get a list of relevant CVEs affecting your network.

Flan Scan is a wrapper over Nmap and the vulners script which turns Nmap into a full-fledged network vulnerability scanner. Flan Scan makes it easy to deploy Nmap locally within a container, push results to the cloud, and deploy the scanner on Kubernetes.

#11 [YOUTUBE - channels for frontend developers](https://github.com/andrew--r/channels) 
A collection of useful YouTube channels and other videos sources for JavaScript developers and web designers.

#12 [wtfjs](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs)
A list of funny and tricky JavaScript examples

JavaScript is a great language. It has a simple syntax, large ecosystem and, what is most important, a great community.

At the same time, we all know that JavaScript is quite a funny language with tricky parts. Some of them can quickly turn our everyday job into hell, and some of them can make us laugh out loud.

#13 [You-Dont-Need-jQuery](https://github.com/nefe/You-Dont-Need-jQuery)
Frontend environments evolve rapidly nowadays and modern browsers have already implemented a great deal of DOM/BOM APIs which are good enough for production use. We don't have to learn jQuery from scratch for DOM manipulation or event handling. In the meantime, thanks to the spread of frontend libraries such as React, Angular and Vue, manipulating the DOM directly becomes anti-pattern, so that jQuery usage has never been less important. This project summarizes most of the alternatives in native Javascript implementation to jQuery methods, with IE 10+ support.

#37 [og-aws](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws)
Amazon Web Services — a practical guide A lot of information on AWS is already written. Most people learn AWS by reading a blog or a “getting started guide” and referring to the standard AWS references. Nonetheless, trustworthy and practical information and recommendations aren’t easy to come by. AWS’s own documentation is a great but sprawling resource few have time to read fully, and it doesn’t include anything but official facts, so omits experiences of engineers. The information in blogs or Stack Overflow is also not consistently up to date.

This guide is by and for engineers who use AWS. It aims to be a useful, living reference that consolidates links, tips, gotchas, and best practices. It arose from discussion and editing over beers by several engineers who have used AWS extensively.

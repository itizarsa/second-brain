## Here's what you can do

Dendron helps you find relationships between your notes and provides enough structure so youâ€™re never lost

Dendron finds the usable center between unstructured backlinks and rigid file hierarchies. We help users maintain a canonical hierarchy for every note while also allowing for arbitrary backlinks to any other note.

There are some notes you want to put out into the world and some that you don't. Dendron makes it easy to control what gets shared, and what stays private.

Dendron has given me the opportunity to have a one-stop place for all my notes, random thoughts and project planning right where I feel at home - in VSCode [...] I use Dendron mostly to manage multiple projects to keep track of meeting notes, TODOs, planned features and sharing all of this with my colleagues."

"The last time I felt excited about learning a tool like this was when I started learning vim... it has never stopped and I suspect my usage of this tool will evolve similarly."

"Hierarchies [are] such a game changer. I just couldn't organize myself with a flat structure and ended up spreading notes out. The key thing that changed my perspective was the ease of restructuring hierarchies, it gives you the confidence to just write, safe in the knowledge that you can just restructure it later"

"Dendron is awesome. Each day the simple things are getting easier."

After trying all the big and little names in building a personal knowledge base, Dendron was the right fit of features, philosophy, and velocity. Dendron checks all the boxes you're looking for in a knowledge management system.

The hierarchical nature is what made me settle with Dendron after many failed attempts to build a personal knowledge base with other software. I loved it so much that I decided it was finally time to contribute to an open source project. I can tell you that the dev community is also very welcoming.

I've been using Dendron exclusively for my daily journal and notetaking since last week. 
Now that I've learned about PARA and figured out the hierarchy that best works for me, I'm absolutely loving it! [...] It took me a couple of days to figure out the best workflow and transfer my past notes, I'm now moving faster and able to create, update, and find notes quickly.

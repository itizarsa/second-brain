This tutorial would ideally be helpful for people who build/manage multiple projects, while wanting a custom domain name + email address for each.

# Why not just use G Suite?

It has something to do with costs. (It always does, doesn‚Äôt it?)

Granted, a G Suite account will indeed allow you to ‚Äúcreate business email addresses for your domain, and get 30GB of space.‚Äù

Plus, once you have signed up for a G Suite account, you will have the option to create email ‚Äúaliases‚Äù ‚Äî which will be useful for setting up several different identities / message filters for your brand (more on G Suite aliases in a future post, potentially).

And for the sake of full disclosure, I do use G Suite for my *main* company email addresses.

However, if you are like me and actively run a ton of standalone projects, G Suite fees will add up‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs say you have 20 standalone projects that each uses its own domain. G Suite fees would come out to be:

$5.00 / user / month x 12 months x 20 projects = $1,200 per year

Versus‚Ä¶

Cost of this setup = $0

You will only need to pay the domain fee on an annual basis.

# The goals of my setup

What I am trying to achieve here:

- Get a **custom domain name** (wearemojis.com) for a small annual subscription fee from Google Domains ‚Äî currently $12/year
- Sign up for a **free Gmail account** to use with the project (weallwearemojis@gmail.com)
- Set up a **custom domain email address for free** (crying.kitty@wearemojis.com) via Google Domains, making use of the purchased custom domain
- Have emails that are sent to the custom domain email (crying.kitty@wearemojis.com) automatically **forwarded to the Gmail account** (weallwearemojis@gmail.com)
- **Send email as** crying.kitty@wearemojis.com
- Eliminate the need to purchase a new G Suite account for every new project
- Make the most of all the free Google services that come with the Gmail account

# Now, the step-by-step guide

1. Sign up for a free Gmail account. In my case, it‚Äôs weallwearemojis@gmail.com (not a real email address).
2. Purchase a custom domain for your project from Google Domains.

USD$12.00

3. From Google Domains, set up Email Forwarding: Click on **Add email** next to the desired domain > type in the alias you want > enter the existing email you want to forward to > click the **Add** button

In my case, I‚Äôm trying to have messages sent to *crying.kitty@wearemojis.com* forwarded to my Gmail, *weallwearemojis@gmail.com.*

4. Confirm your existing email (check your Gmail inbox for the message).

Actual emails grayed out to avoid spam

## **At this point, you are pretty much good to go!**

All emails sent to *crying.ktity@wearemojis.com* can now be found in the Gmail inbox of *weallwearemojis@gmail.com.*

Simple as that!

## [Optional] But what if you want to be able to ‚Äúsend‚Äù or ‚Äúreply to‚Äù emails from your custom email address?

You are probably aware that with this setup, you don‚Äôt actually ‚Äúsend‚Äù and ‚Äúreceive‚Äù emails with your custom email (*crying.kitty@wearemojis.com* for me).

You don‚Äôt really touch an inbox or other folders of the custom email.

But thanks to the magic of email forwarding and Gmail alias, you will be able to act as if you are doing just that.

# Additional steps to set up the ‚Äúsending from‚Äù part:

**Part I.** Set up an App Password for your Gmail account to allow you to use the Gmail SMTP servers securely.

5. Go to the Gmail account. Click your username or user icon in the upper right corner to bring up the user menu.

1. [wearemojis.com](https://www.teepublic.com/user/wearemojis) is indeed one of my domains. Have a look at the site if you want ‚Äî and maybe buy a t-shirt or two while you‚Äôre there ;)
2. All other email accounts in this tutorial are completely made up and won‚Äôt actually work ‚Äî so there is no need to waste time spamming those üëê

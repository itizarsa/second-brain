Mentors play an instrumental role in career progression. That's why we've established a free mentoring platform to enable everyone in our community to connect with amazing mentors, that have been handpicked by us.

All you need to know about mentorship.

What is the difference between a Mentor and a Mentee?

**Mentors** are people who can support, advise and guide you. The purpose of a mentor is to help you excel in your career and become the best version of yourself.This may involve helping you achieve your goals, introducing you to new ways of thinking, challenging any limiting assumptions, teaching you life lessons, and much more.

**Mentees** are individuals who are looking to take the next step by taking an active role in their own learning. They are keen to identify and act on learning goals as well as being open to feedback.

I've never done anything like this before, what should I expect?

Reaching out to a mentor is an important first step. Once you've requested to contact a mentor, they will reach out to arrange a convenient time to connect. The mentor will ask you impactful questions to best understand your career objectives and work toward meeting them. They can help you to define a career plan or provide advice where you need it. Expect a mix of guiding questions, thought partnership, and action steps to help you with what comes next.

This is a voluntary service for mentors and mentees. We advise only on an initial hour to help set some clear goals and a 3, 6 or 12 month career plan. Our mentors are selected because of their experiences and we are keen to grow a mentoring community that enables networking and peer to peer mentoring with regular check ins and a effective network of industry soundboards.

What are my responsibilities?

Both individuals should arrange a mutual hour conversation and provide some advice, help and guidance. If you wish to take the mentoring relationship further, all participants should review the Inclusive Career's mentoring agreement which ensures best practice to mentoring.

**Mentors** commit around 1 hour for each mentee and approximately 1-2 hours per month dependent upon mentees reaching out to you. If you are receiving lots of invitations to connect from mentees, please email us on [info@inclusive.careers](mailto:info@inclusive.careers), as we can help to provide suitable alternative great mentors.

**Mentees** commit to 1 hour to meet with your mentor and to refer to Inclusive Career's 'Ask your mentor' guide if stuck for ideas. It's an informal relationship so don't worry if you just want a sound board to help you navigate your next career step.

# Book technical mock interviews with engineers from top companies

Your interviewer will be a senior engineer from FAANG or other top companies, who has extensive technical interview experience. They'll run you through exactly the kinds of questions you'd see in real interviews.

- Mock technical interviews & mentorship sessions:
    - Algorithms and data structures
    - Systems design
    - Front-end engineering
    - Engineering management
    - Behavioral practice interviews
- Google/Facebook 1-on-1 intensive courses:
    - If you're serious about getting hired at Google or Facebook, this is the best way to maximize your chances of getting an offer. We'll pair you with an experienced interviewer from Google or Facebook, who will design a lesson plan customized to you and the role you're applying for. Through 10, one-on-one sessions with your mentor, you'll cover everything you need to know to ace your interview and land your dream job.

Interviews start at $100, but if you can’t pay, don’t worry. You can defer payment until you find a job.

You'll join your interviewer in our version of CoderPad™ for a fully anonymous session with audio and chat (but no video). Afterwards, you can unmask and connect with your interviewer if you'd like.

Each session ends with an in-depth rundown of what you did well on and what you need to improve, all from a senior engineer who’s made hiring decisions at FAANG.

"I think getting used to the pressure of an interview is the most important part of preparation. And it's also the hardest to simulate. Interviewing.io has taken care of that for me! It’s like that friend I can always bug for help with running through questions."

"interviewing.io was more than a small part of my success. Your platform gave me the comfort and confidence to treat my interviews like a fun, relaxing conversation over shared interests, rather than the terrifying psychological gauntlet that they started as."

"I just wanted to let you both know that I did my Google onsite and to my surprised amazement I just received the email saying they're moving me on to team-matching! ✨ Wanted to say thanks to you in general for building a company that helped me get to this point and specifically for... the concept of mentoring sessions. They were super helpful and I think made the difference between offer/no-offer for me."

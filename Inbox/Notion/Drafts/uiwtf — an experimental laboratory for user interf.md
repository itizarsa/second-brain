We've all experienced this one interaction that you can't stop playing with because it just *feels* right.

We wish to build user interfaces of the future because they are exciting and challenging to create.

uiwtf is an **experimental laboratory of user interface patterns and interactions** that make you think "what the fuck?" in a thought-provoking way.

I hope these inspire you to build cool shit. ðŸ–¤

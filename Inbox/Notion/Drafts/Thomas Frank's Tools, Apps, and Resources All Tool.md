Every software-based tool that I use to run my business - including my YouTube/Nebula channels, podcast, websites (College Info Geek and my personal website, thomasjfrank.com), music side projects, accounting/budgeting, team management, and more. Physical gear (working on updating this soon): [https://www.amazon.com/shop/thomasfrank](https://www.amazon.com/shop/thomasfrank) Change the database view to see different sorting methods, free tools, and more. For items marked as having affiliate links, I'll receive a commission if you use that link to purchase anything. If you chose to do so, thank you!

Figma Mirror

Creation Tool

Really handy iPhone app that displays a mirrored version of whatever composition you have selected on Figma Desktop - and shows all updates in real time. You can use this to design smartphone UI - and see how it looks on an actual smartphone - in real-time. It's surprisingly useful, as looking at a composition on a big monitor - even when it's set to the correct resolution and zoom level - just doesn't give you an accurate picture of what your design truly looks like on a phone.

HostGator

Blogging/Websites

Hosting

Web host for most of my sites that aren't College Info Geek. This is what I started on back in 2009 when I got into building websites. It's incredibly inexpensive and works well for sites that don't have a huge amount of traffic. IIRC, we moved CIG to a more expensive host around the time we were getting about 200,000 pageviews per month.

My link will get you up to 62% off your first purchase (the discount scales up with the initial amount of months you buy), so it's much better than the normal link.

WP Engine

Blogging/Websites

Hosting

Web hosting platform I use for College Info Geek. This is much faster hosting than what HostGator provides, and has better backup options. It is also at least more than 10x the price. I still use HG for smaller side-project sites, but the combo of WP Engine + CloudFlare makes CIG incredibly fast, even with ~400,000 monthly visitors.

As far as I can tell, there's no special incentive for using my affiliate link, so no worries if you aren't inclined. Also, I'd recommend checking out HostGator unless you're already running a large site or know you don't want to worry about things like site backup (which is fairly easy and cheap through plugins and S3/Dropbox/etc)

Lasso

Plugin that lets us create a central database of all our monetized links. Instead of directly placing affiliate links in our content, we create an entry in Lasso, which then creates a redirect (example - collegeinfogeek.com/go/lasso). There are several benefits to this; the main one is that we can easily update a link in one place instead of having to find every instance of it across our entire site.

As far as I can tell, there's no special incentive for using my affiliate link, so no worries if you aren't inclined. Additional disclosure: This plugin was built by my friends Andrew Fiebert and Matt Giovanisci. On CIG, we actually use a version of Lasso that is much older and that works somewhat differently than the public one. It includes custom code written specifically for CIG.

ConvertKit

Email Marketing

Marketing

Email marketing platform that we currently use. It's not cheap, but I like the tools for creating automations and sequences. Very powerful for anyone doing product sales through email.

Web

As far as I can tell, there's no special incentive for using my affiliate link, so no worries if you aren't inclined. Also, if your list is <2,000 subscribers, MailChimp is free until you hit that limit. I like CK more, but it's hard to argue with free.

Fundrise

Finance/Accounting

Investing Platform

About 10% of my monthly investment goes here. Fundrise invests in larger-scale real estate deals (like apartment complexes), which essentially offers me an option in between REITs and actual real-estate investing (something I have no interest in at the moment). I consider it an additional diversification option that is quite growth-focused.

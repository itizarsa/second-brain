In this [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) course, we go from a completely empty directory to a full-blown marketing site for a design agency, and along the way, **we dive really deep into Eleventy** *and* **front-end development best practices**.

Over the course of **31 written lessons**, split over **4 modules**, you will learn **core Eleventy platform knowledge**—*step-by-step*—to build out a real-world project. The linear project structure **helps your learning** because you’re **working with a real context**, rather than foo bar or fizzbuzz. This also means you’ll actually achieve something at the end that you can build on, too!

## About your instructor

Your instructor for Learn Eleventy From Scratch is me, Andy Bell—a freelance designer and front-end developer—based in the UK. I have worked in the design and web industries for well over a decade and in that time, I have worked with some of the largest organisations in the world, like Google, Harley-Davidson, BSkyB, Unilever, Oracle, Capita, Vice Media and the NHS.

Over these years, I have worked on both extremely large projects for huge organisations and tiny projects for small startups. This has given me a lot of experience over a large variety of project types. It also means I’ve worked with a lot of teams in various sizes—each with their own constraints and goals. These projects vary between design systems, creative campaign work and good ol’ websites.

I mostly specialise in CSS—whether that is writing a [course for Google](https://web.dev/learn/css/), co-authoring a [book on CSS layout](https://every-layout.dev/), or creating a [methodology to help people write better CSS](https://cube.fyi/). Most of my client work involves me applying this experience to help teams write better CSS—often by helping them create a design system.

You can read more about me over on my [personal blog](https://andy-bell.co.uk/), or catch up with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/piccalilli_), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/piccalilli) or [Github](https://github.com/andy-piccalilli).

## Table of contents

Welcome! Here’s *all* of the lessons for this course. Let’s get cracking!

## Module 1: Let’s build a website

- Welcome aboard. Let’s take a look at what we’re making in this course and what you’ll need to get started.
- Time to get your site up and running in the browser with a good old-fashioned “Hello, world”.
- Now that we have Eleventy up and running with a “Hello, world” example, let’s add some HTML and Nunjucks.
- Learn about what Front Matter is, why it’s useful and how we can use it to super-charge our site’s content.
- A quick tutorial on telling Eleventy to copy files over to your website output.
- A quick tour of partials and how we can include them by adding our site header.
- We’re diving into Eleventy’s data capability and making sections of the site dynamic.
- Collections are a crucial part of Eleventy’s capabilities, so it’s time to learn about them.
- Data doesn’t have to be local and static. Using the power of JavaScript data files, we’re going to pull in some remote data and render it on a template.
- We’ve achieved a heck of a lot over the last 9 lessons so let’s gather round and recap what we’ve learned.
- Time to pick up the pace and dig in to what Eleventy is best known for by creating our front-end feeds.
- After a pretty full-on start to this blog, let’s spend some time focusing on the blog post view, filters and setting global data for directories.
- Most of our blog template is done and dusted. All we have to do now is add a recommended posts section at the end.
- A nice straightforward page build using some of the knowledge we’ve already learned.
- Another quick and (hopefully) easy lesson to give you a chance to practice your new skills.
- Time to add a core page to the site and learn about linked content.
- Let’s wrap up our HTML-only build of the website and recap on where we’ve got to.

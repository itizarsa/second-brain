## One file is all you need.

At the heart of Gitpages is your gitpage.yml file.

You decide what elements (we call them blocks) you want to display and we will do the rest. All blocks are highly configurable.

> “When I first heard about Gitpages, instantly thought `Why nobody thought about it before!` but when I saw David publishing updates on Twitter about this progress and ideas, I instantly realized it's going to be much more than just a simple landing page generator. It's going to give every open-source project a beautiful and practical landing page.”

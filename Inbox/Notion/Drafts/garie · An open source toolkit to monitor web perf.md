### Performance Reports

Every time Garie collects performance metrics, it can store Lighthouse reports.

This data can help you visually see what is happening in your applications & also tell you where and how to improve.

### Performance Videos

Garie also collects videos of your application, so you can visualy see what is happening thanks to the Browsertime Plugin.

### Built with Docker

Garie is built on a Docker architecture. Data is collected inside each of Garie's plugins (containers) and Garie reads the performance data collected.

All the plugins collect data and save it into InfluxDB. Garie then uses Grafana to help visualise the data.

Each plugin also has its own API - some even collect reports & videos which are all accessible.

Garie was built to help people get a better understanding of web performance and an easy way to start monitoring your applications.

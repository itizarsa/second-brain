## The book, in brief

**Inclusive Components** examines common web UI patterns through the lens of inclusion. The aim is to find more accessible and robust solutions for the patterns we author, plug in, and use every day.

Each chapter tackles a single component, addressing how different and vulnerable people might read and interact with it, and how they can be better accommodated. The in-depth explorations are meticulously illustrated and code examples culminate as working demos.

Inclusive design is not about wrong and right, but *bad to better*. You'll learn plenty of tips from **Inclusive Components**, but you'll also adopt the mindset to go on and make even better components.

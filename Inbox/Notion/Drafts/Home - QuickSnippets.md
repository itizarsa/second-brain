Trying to Represent default values ​​that cannot be expressed in [@prisma](https://twitter.com/prisma) schema(gen_random_uuid()). with [@supabase_io](https://twitter.com/supabase_io) Thank you [@iwatakeshi](https://twitter.com/iwatakeshi)

🔹 Promise.allSettled() The Promise.allSettled() method returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have either fulfilled or rejected, with an array of objects that each describes the outcome of each promise.

JavaScript Tip 💡 You can use Object.entries() to iterate through the properties of an object and access both key and value. No need to do an object lookup for each iteration.

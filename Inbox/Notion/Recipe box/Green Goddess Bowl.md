# Instructions

1. In a medium sized pot, add quinoa and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cover for 15 minutes or until water is absorbed.
2. In a separate pan, heat the vegetable broth (or oil; I no longer cook with oil) and saut√© the onions with the garlic for 2 minutes. Add the frozen edamame and zucchini. Cook for about 5 minutes. Add the kale last and cook about 1 minute until softened. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Turn off heat.
3. Prepare the dressing in a small bowl by adding all of the ingredients and whisking until smooth.
4. Scoop the quinoa into a bowl, top with the vegetable mixture and drizzle on the dressing.Enjoy!

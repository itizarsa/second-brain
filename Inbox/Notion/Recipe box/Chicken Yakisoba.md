> *I love the simplicity of Japanese cuisine and how easy it is to replicate some of the dishes that are commonly served in Japanese restaurants. Many of the recipes are often quite simple with a relatively short list of ingredients, and the dishes can be prepared in a short period of time. Yakisoba, which is a dish of fried noodles very popular in Japan, is a dish that is usually prepared in street stalls of fast food, usually contain cabbage, meat and other vegetables, and topped with aonori, (which are green seaweed flakes) ), roasted sesame seeds and spicy ginger. The noodles are dressed with yakisoba sauce which is a thicker and spicier version of the Worchestershire sauce, the yakisoba sauce can be bought already prepared but I think it is more interesting that we prepare it ourselves. The noodles that we will use in this recipe will be already cooked wheat, they are sold in individual portions, you just have to cook them for a few seconds so that they are loose, but you can also buy them dry.*

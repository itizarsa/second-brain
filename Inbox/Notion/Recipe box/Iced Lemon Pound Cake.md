### For the **Pound Cake**

- [ ]  1 1/4 cups GF flour
- [ ]  3/4 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it)
- [ ]  1/4 cup cornstarch
- [ ]  1 teaspoon kosher salt
- [ ]  Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
- [ ]  12 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
- [ ]  4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
- [ ]  1 cup granulated sugar
- [ ]  4 eggs at room temperature, beaten
- [ ]  2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

### **For the Glaze**

- [ ]  1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar
- [ ]  1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- [ ]  3 to 4 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

# Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F. Grease a loaf pan that is no more than 9-inches by 5-inches, and set it aside.
2. In a small bowl, combine the flour, xanthan gum, cornstarch, salt and about 3/4 of the lemon zest, and whisk to combine well, working to break up any clumps of lemon zest. Set the bowl aside.
3. **Make the pound cake batter.** In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand mixer), place the butter and cream cheese and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy (about 5 minutes). Add the granulated sugar and mix to combine. Add the eggs and lemon juice, mixing well after each addition until the mixture is smooth. Add the flour mixture in 3 parts, beating well to combine after each addition. The batter will be smooth and thick, but relatively light. Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan, and smooth the top with a wet spatula.
4. **Bake the pound cake.** Place the loaf pan in the center of the preheated oven and bake until a tester inserted in the center of the pound cake comes out clean (about 50 minutes). If the loaf begins to brown too much, cover it tightly with a piece of aluminum foil. Remove the pound cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for 15 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.
5. **Make the glaze & assemble the cake.** Once the pound cake is nearly cool, make the glaze. In a small bowl, place the confectioner’s sugar, salt, and the remaining lemon zest, and whisk to combine and to break up any lumps in the confectioner’s sugar or the lemon zest. Add the lemon juice, 1 teaspoon at a time, and mix well. Continue to add lemon juice by the teaspoon, stirring in between additions, until the glaze is thickly pourable. Pour the glaze over the cooled pound cake, and allow to set at room temperature. Slice and serve.

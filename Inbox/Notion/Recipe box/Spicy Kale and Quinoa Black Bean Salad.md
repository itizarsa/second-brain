# Shopping List

- [ ]  1 c quinoa, uncooked
- [ ]  6 c chopped kale, de-stemmed
- [ ]  1/2 red onion, chopped
- [ ]  1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
- [ ]  1 c corn

**For the dressing:**

- [ ]  1/4 c fresh cilantro, chopped
- [ ]  1 clove garlic, minced
- [ ]  1/4 c fresh lime juice (about 2 limes)
- [ ]  1/4 c hot sauce of your choice
- [ ]  1/4 c water
- [ ]  1 tsp maple syrup
- [ ]  1/2 tsp cumin

# Instructions

1. In a medium sized pot, combine 2 cups of water with 1 cup of quinoa and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until water is absorbed and quinoa is fluffy.
2. In a large salad bowl, add the kale and the onion.
3. Once the quinoa is done cooking, add in the black beans and corn to the pot. Mix it up. You could just add these over the kale but I wanted to warm up the beans and corn. Add the quinoa mixture over the kale and mix.
4. Prepare the dressing. Pour the dressing over the salad, mix and enjoy!

# Instructions

## **Make the Gluten-Free Pie Crust**

1. Gather the ingredients.
2. Measure dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Use a large whisk to thoroughly blend ingredients.
3. Pour the dry ingredients into a food processor bowl, fitted with a metal blade. Add the cold butter cubes and pulse until the butter cubes are reduced to the size of peas and the mixture looks like coarse, dry crumbs.
4. Add the lightly beaten egg and pulse just until egg is incorporated into the flour-butter mix.
5. Add 1 tablespoon of ice water and pulse several times.
6. Remove the processor lid and squeeze a small amount of the dough in your hand. If it holds together don't add more water. If the dough is too crumbly and dry, add 1/4 teaspoon additional ice water and pulse several more times. Check the consistency of the dough again. If the dough holds together and you can form a ball don't add more water. Adding too much water will make the dough sticky and harder to roll out and shape.
7. Scrape the dough, which will look crumbly, on a clean, gluten-free work surface covered with waxed paper. Gather the crumbly dough into a ball.
8. Flatten to a large disk shape. Wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate for at least one hour before rolling out the dough. (If you're making this dough ahead of time, it is at this stage where the dough can be frozen. Place wax paper wrapped dough in a freezer bag, label and freeze for future use.)

## **Roll Out the Dough**

1. Remove dough from refrigerator and place dough between two sheets of waxed paper. Let dough sit just until it's soft enough to roll.
2. When workable, lightly roll from the center outward, working to make a circle about 10-inches in diameter and about 1/8-inch thick. If the dough should get too warm and sticky, place it in the freezer for several minutes and then continue rolling it.
3. Peel top sheet of wax paper from the dough and carefully flip the dough, on the remaining sheet of waxed paper, over pie plate. Gently peel the waxed paper from the dough.
4. Gently press the dough into the pie plate.
5. Trim edges with knife and crimp edge with a fork or using your favorite method. Your pie crust is now ready to be filled.

## **Make the Apple Pie Filling**

1. Gather the ingredients.
2. Combine sugar, sweet rice flour or tapioca starch, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a large bowl and use a whisk to thoroughly blend ingredients.
3. Add sliced apples and gently coat apples with sugar mixture.
4. Pour apples into dough-lined pie plate and distribute them evenly.
5. Dot the top of the apples with cubed butter.
6. Place the second prepared crust over the top of the apples. Press edges to seal dough and use your favorite method to flute the edges (pressed with fork tines, etc.).
7. Cut or poke several small vents in the top of the pie crust.

## **Bake the Apple Pie**

1. Preheat oven to 425 F.
2. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until top is golden brown and apples are tender.
3. Check frequently. If edges brown too quickly, place a strip of foil around the edge to prevent burning.
4. Allow pie to cool for several minutes before cutting.
5. Slice and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

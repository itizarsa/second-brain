# Shopping List

- [ ]  4 eggs
- [ ]  1/2 c full fat coconut milk from a can, blended
- [ ]  6 tbsp raw honey
- [ ]  1/4 c fresh lemon juice
- [ ]  zest of 1 small lemon
- [ ]  3 tbsp coconut oil, melted and cooled

- [ ]  1 tsp pure vanilla extract
- [ ]  2/3 c coconut flour
- [ ]  1/4 c tapioca flour
- [ ]  1 tsp baking soda
- [ ]  1/8 tsp salt

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350ยบ F and prepare a 12 cup muffin pan by lining with muffin liners.
2. In a large bowl using an electric hand mixer, blend together the eggs, coconut milk, honey, lemon juice, zest, vanilla and coconut oil.
3. In a second bowl, combined the coconut and tapioca flours, baking soda and salt. Slowly add this mixture to the wet ingredients, blending on low speed until just combined.
4. The batter will be thick, this is normal for coconut flour recipes! Using a large spoon, fill each lined muffin cup 3/4 of the way up. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of one comes out clean.
5. Allow to cool in the pan a couple of minutes, then remove each muffin (still in the liner) and allow to cool completely on wire racks.

*Note:* Store leftovers in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or freeze for later use.

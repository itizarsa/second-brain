The first task is to build a **Nand**-component from electric relays.

A Nand-component only outputs 0 when both (**a** and **b**) inputs are 1:

**1** represents some electrical current, **0** represents no current.

The **V** input carries constant current, i.e. always 1.

There are two types of relays: One is on by default and needs current to switch off. The other is off by default and needs current to switch on.

Welcome to **The Nand Game**!

You are going to build a computer starting from basic components.

The game consists of a series of levels. In each level, you are tasked with building a component that behaves according to a specification. This component can then be used as a building block in the next level.

The game does not require any previous knowledge about computer architecture or software, and does not require math skills beyond addition and subtraction. (It does require some patienceâ€”some of the tasks might take a while to solve!)

Your first task is to build a **nand** component.

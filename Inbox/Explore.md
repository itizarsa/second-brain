As design lead, I helped create the web experience for Google I/O’s first all-virtual developer conference.

- 

Colorful brand moments were sprinkled throughout the site to create a truly distinct experience.

- 

Scrolling to the bottom of the homepage initiated a game of breakout. Players had five chances to eliminate all circles while collecting falling letters. These letters spelled out a clue that, when typed into the Chrome console, rewarded players with an I/O badge.

- 

The I/O schedule was designed to intuitively display a mixture of live events and timed bulk session releases.

- 

### Built for all

We developed a light and dark design system that reflected Google’s commitment to accessibility and advocated for inclusive features like sign language interpretation.

- 

A slim side panel gave attendees quick access to session info, downloadable resources, chat functionality, and Q&A without interrupting their stream.

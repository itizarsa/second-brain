### How Does Our Paid Resume Writing Service Work?

Our service works a little differently from the other resume writing services out there. We, unlike some other services, won’t just send you a resume template to fill in (let’s be honest here – you can those free online so easily, why would you choose to pay for one?).

You will receive one to one help from a professional who will provide you with guidance and support through every step of the process.

Our writers are all vetted and undergo a testing process to ensure they really are the best person to write your resume.

### What Our Customers Say

We really do believe that our resume writing service is the best service available, but then of course we would say that right!

But it’s not just us who think our service is pretty amazing. In fact, our customers believe we are fabulous too. You can check out our testimonials from our past customers to see how we have helped make people’s career goals a reality.

Many job seekers still view their cover letter as something that merely needs to tell recruiters their CV or resume is attached. That’s not the case at all. Recruiters can see for themselves what you’ve attached. 
Your cover letter is your chance to pick the main points from the job description and illustrate your experience in this area. A well written cover letter guarantees your CV or resume will be given a chance. 
We can write you a winning cover letter, specifically tailored to the company/job opening that you are interested in.

This is more important than you think. Once a good recruiter has decided you’re a potential candidate, they will check out your social media profiles. For Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc., as long as you use a bit of common sense, you’ll be fine. LinkedIn is another matter. Recruiters expect a professional profile that matches your CV’s claims. They don’t want to see a half put together profile that never gets updated. 
We can help make your LinkedIn profile an asset to you rather than a hindrance.

Maybe you’ve got your resume written perfectly. All the information is there, it’s concise and you know it’s pretty impressive. Now for the hard part. Design. 
Remember the seven second rule? Your design has to invite someone to read your resume, not put them off. Unless you are applying for particularly creative roles, your resume needs a clean, professional looking design that isn’t boring and is easy to skim read. 
We have expert designers who will ensure your resume fits the bill.

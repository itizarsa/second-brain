Use our collaborative editor to create motion graphics that respond to different states and user inputs. Then load your animations into apps, games, and websites with our lightweight runtimes.

Enable your team to collaborate on the same files, in real time, from any location. With teams, product designers can work together to follow a consistent motion language. Game designers can share their assets in a centralized location. Engineers gain insight into the design process and can see how assets are rigged.

Videos require an image for each frame, but Rive animations only store animation data like bone position and rotation. This means that interactive animations can take up as little space as a static image. Rive also supports vector graphics, which means your animations take up even less space and are resolution independent.

Animations in Rive are interpolated in real time with your app or game's frame rate. This means you can change the speed at which your animation is playing at any time, like going into slow-motion, without losing any quality.

Integrate your Rive animations into interactions throughout your app to create a unique, joyful experience that stands out amongst others.

Not only can Rive animations smoothly blend from one to another, but they can also layer on top of one another. You can use this technique to blend multiple animations together depending on the state of your app. Rather than creating all the different combinations of these states, animators only have to create one animation, freeing up their time to work on something else.

Of course, all of this can be manipulated with code to add even more interactivity. Connect your graphics to data, swap out images at runtime, change colors, follow the mouse position, and more.

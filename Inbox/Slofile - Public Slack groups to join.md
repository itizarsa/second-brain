Founded in 2014, Product School is the world’s first technology business school. We provide certified courses in Product Management, Data Analytics, Coding, Digital Marketing, UX Design and Product Leadership to professionals across 16 campuses worldwide. In addition to on-site campuses, we also offer the same courses, live online. Both on-site and online courses are taught by real-world product managers who work at top technology companies such as Google, Facebook, PayPal, Airbnb, LinkedIn and Netflix. Unlike traditional MBA programs designed for students seeking roles within the finance and consulting fields, Product School’s curriculum is highly relevant for the next generation of technology leaders, with classes offered at a fraction of the cost. The curriculum is designed to fit into work schedules with small classes held in the evenings or on weekends to ensure that both instructors and students can maintain their full-time jobs. Expect a healthy mix of hands-on projects, group exercises, case studies, panel discussions and a variety of other forums to teach you how to lead cross-functional teams and build digital products from end to end. We also prepare students for product management interviews and enable them to expand their professional network through access to a private community of thousands of people; including alumni, mentors and hiring managers from top technology companies. Product School also offers custom corporate training programs for Fortune 500 companies seeking to advance the product management skill sets of their existing teams or onboard new talent. Committed to building the largest product management community, Product School has published the Amazon’s best-selling book The Product Book, runs The Product Awards ceremony and ProductCon, a multi-city product management conference.

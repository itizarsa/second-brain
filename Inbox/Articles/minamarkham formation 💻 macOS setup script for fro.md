> Formation is a shell script to set up a macOS laptop for design and development.
> 

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Install

Download the script:

```
git clone git@github.com/minamarkham/formation.git && cd formation
```

Review the script (please don't run scripts you don't understand):

```
less slay
```

Slay:

```
cd formation
./slay 2>&1 | tee ~/slay.log
```

Just follow the prompts and youâ€™ll be fine.

Warning: I advise against running [this script](https://github.com/minamarkham/formation/blob/master/slay) unless you understand what itâ€™s doing to your computer.

I created this based on my own preferences; your mileage may vary.

Once the script is done, quit and relaunch Terminal.

It is highly recommended to run the script regularly to keep your computer up to date.

Your last Formation run will be saved to `~/slay.log`. To review it, run `less ~/slay.log`.

That's it!

## Just add `~/.hot-sauce`

![minamarkham%20formation%20%F0%9F%92%BB%20macOS%20setup%20script%20for%20fro%2041d86bf386ea4ad18e41f731f91d1aaf/1f336.png](minamarkham%20formation%20%F0%9F%92%BB%20macOS%20setup%20script%20for%20fro%2041d86bf386ea4ad18e41f731f91d1aaf/1f336.png)

![minamarkham%20formation%20%F0%9F%92%BB%20macOS%20setup%20script%20for%20fro%2041d86bf386ea4ad18e41f731f91d1aaf/hot-sauce.gif](minamarkham%20formation%20%F0%9F%92%BB%20macOS%20setup%20script%20for%20fro%2041d86bf386ea4ad18e41f731f91d1aaf/hot-sauce.gif)

Your `~/.hot-sauce` is added at the end of the Formation script. Put your customizations there. For example:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

SETUP_ROOT=$HOME/.setup

NERDFONTS_RELEASE=$(curl -L -s -H 'Accept: application/json' https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest)
NERDFONTS_VERSION=$(get_github_version $NERDFONTS_RELEASE)

DIRECTORIES=(
 $HOME/Desktop/code
 $HOME/Desktop/design
 $HOME/Desktop/*dump
 $HOME/Desktop/GIFs
 $HOME/Desktop/projects
 $HOME/Desktop/screenshots
)

NERDFONTS=(
 SpaceMono
 Hack
 AnonymousPro
 Inconsolata
)

step "Making directoriesâ€¦"
for dir in ${DIRECTORIES[@]}; do
 mkd $dir
done

step "Installing fontsâ€¦"
for font in ${NERDFONTS[@]}; do
 if [ ! -d ~/Library/Fonts/$font ]; then
 printf "${indent} [â†“] $font "
 wget -P ~/Library/Fonts https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/$NERDFONTS_VERSION/$font.zip --quiet;unzip -q ~/Library/Fonts/$font -d ~/Library/Fonts/$font
 print_in_green "${bold}âœ“ done!${normal}\n"
 else
 print_muted "${indent}âœ“ $font already installed. Skipped."
 fi
done
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once. See the `slay` script for examples.

Formation functions such as `step` and `link` can be used in your `~/.hot-sauce`.

## Known Issues

Cask does not recognize applications installed outside of Homebrew Cask â€“ in the case that the script fails, you can either remove the application from the install list or uninstall the application causing the failure and try again.

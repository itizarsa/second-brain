## Simple, reusable components

For a clean looking design that doesn't get in the way

MVP styles your root HTML elements, so you don't need to learn a new CSS framework or naming conventions.

MVP is designed to look great on all browsers and devices out of the box for rapid prototyping.  
It's like an amped up CSS reset that you can toss into any project to get decent styling.

MVP is released under the permissive MIT license so you can freely use it however you'd like. 
That means personal projects, commercial ventures, remixes and more are all welcome.

> "By far the easiest stylesheet I've ever used. It integrates easily into one all of my startup projects." - Andy Brewer, Author of MVP.css

## What is Z-Index?

The `z-index` property defines the order of the elements on the z-axis. Basically, it works on elements with a position value other than `static`.

The duck and the ring are within the same parent (the water). Can you guess which will come in front of the other?

```
<div class="water">
   <div class="duck"></div>
   <div class="ring"></div>
</div>
```

The ring has moved a bit. Notice how it’s in top of the duck. This is because latter elements in the HTML are displayed in front of former ones.

```
.ring {
  margin-top: -28px;
}

```

To make the duck appear in front of the ring, we need to apply `position: relative` to it.

```
.duck {
  position: relative;
}

```

Positioned elements appear in front of non-positioned ones.

## How stacking works

Let’s imagine that we have a scene represented in the following HTML markup.

```
<div class="pool">
   <img class="kid" src="kid.svg"/>
   <img class="ring" src="ring.svg"/>
   <img class="water" src="water.svg"/>
</div>
```

How can we make them stack on top of each other like a real-life scene?

![https://ishadeed.com/assets/z-index/img/intro-1@2x.png](https://ishadeed.com/assets/z-index/img/intro-1@2x.png)

I want to make the images overlap with each other, so I added a negative margin.

```
img {
  margin-top: -40px;
}
```

Notice that the water is on top of the ring, and the ring is on top of the boy. Why is that happening?

![https://ishadeed.com/assets/z-index/img/intro-2@2x.png](https://ishadeed.com/assets/z-index/img/intro-2@2x.png)

By default, latter elements in the HTML code will appear in front of former elements.

To arrange them, we need to add `position:relative` and `z-index` to the first two items (The kid and the ring).

```
img {
  margin-top: -75px;
}

.kid {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
}

.ring {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

```

Elements with a higher z-index will be in front of an element that has a smaller one.

## Negative Z-Index

It’s possible to use a negative value for z-index. Let’s learn how it works.

```
<div class="water">
   <div class="duck"></div>
   <div class="ring"></div>
</div>
```

The duck was able to add `z-index: -1` to itself, and it’s hidden. Can you guess where?

```
.duck {
  position: relative;
  z-index: -1;
}

```

In our case, it’s below the parent (the water).

Based on how the source order works, an element with a negative z-index should be above the background of its parent.

Adding `position: relative` and a `z-index` other than auto will prevent the duck from going under its parent.

```
.water {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

.duck {
  position: relative;
  z-index: -1;
}

```

Now, the duck can’t go behind its parent even if you add `z-index: -9999` to it. Why? Because the duck is a part of the water stacking context.

Let’s learn about stacking contexts.

## Stacking contexts

It's a parent that contains one or multiple elements. Those elements will be stacked according to the source order rules, and their z-index values only have meaning within their parent.

```
<div class="water">
   <div class="ring"></div>
</div>
```

To create a stacking context for the water and the ring, you should use a `position` value other than static, and a `z-index` value other than auto.

```
.water {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

.ring {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

```

I like to imagine stacking context as a folder directory.

Note that a stacking context can contian other stacking contexts (AKA nesting).

## What creates a new stacking context?

It’s not necessary to use z-index and positioning to create a stacking contexts. Here is a list of what triggers a stacking context.

Let’s explore a few examples on triggering a new stacking context(s).

1. An element with a position value other than static and z-index other than auto.
2. An element that is a child of a flex container with z-index other than auto.
3. An element with opacity other than 1.
4. An element that has a transform other than none. And more. [View the full list on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context).

### Opacity

In the following example, we have a ring, and we want the duck to be in front of it.

```
<div class="water">
   <div class="duck"></div>
   <div class="ring ring-purple"></div>
</div>
```

Adding an opacity other than 1 creates a new stacking context.

```
.duck {
  opacity: 0.999;
}

```

I added an opacity that is less than 1 to the duck, and it’s done. The duck is in front of the two rings.

### CSS transforms

I want to move the duck in front of the purple ring. How can I do this?

```
<div class="water">
   <div class="ring ring-red"></div>
   <div class="duck"></div>
   <div class="ring ring-purple"></div>
</div>
```

By rotating the duck, the brower will create a new stacking context for the duck. As a result, it will appear in front of the purple ring.

```
.duck {
  transform: rotate(10deg);
}

```

### Clip Path

Applying clip-path to an element will create a new stacking context.

```
<div class="water">
   <div class="ring ring-purple"></div>
   <div class="duck"></div>
</div>
```

Adding a clip-path created a new stacking context. As a result, the purple ring is in front of the duck.

```
.ring-purple {
  clip-path: polygon(
   50% 0%,
   100% 50%,
   50% 100%,
   0% 50%
  );
}

```

Learn more about CSS clip path in [this article](https://ishadeed.com/article/clip-path/).

To make the duck appear in front of the ring, we need to add a stacking context to it with a `z-index` other than `auto`.

```
.ring-purple {
  clip-path: polygon(
    50% 0%,
    100% 50%,
    50% 100%,
    0% 50%
  );
}

.duck {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

```

Since the duck is a positioned element with `z-index` other than auto, it will be in front of the ring.

Let's learn about how the default source order works.

## How the default source order works

The children of a stacking context are stacked from bottom to top in the following order.

The list has been edited For simplicity's sake. If you’re looking for the full stack order, please [read the spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#layers).

- Child element(s) with negative z-index values
- Non-positioned elements
- Positioned elements with z-index: auto
- Positioned elements with z-index: 1 or higher

## Stacking contexts examples

### Example 1: The duck and the mosquito

In the following figure, we have three elements. The water, the red ring, and the purple ring.

We want to position the duck above the mosquito.

```
<div class="water">
   <div class="ring ring-red">
     <div class="duck"></div>
     <div class="mosquito"></div>
   </div>
   <div class="ring ring-purple"></div>
</div>
```

Consider that the water has a stacking context.

```
.water {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

```

I added `z-index: 1` to the duck to make it above the mosquito.

```
.duck {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

```

The duck is now above the mosquito and its happy. However, it appears above the purple ring. Why did that happen?

Since the purple ring is in the same stacking context as the red ring, but has no z-index, it appears below the duck.

To solve this, we need to introduce a stacking context to the red ring.

To create a stacking context for the red ring, I will add a CSS `position` and `z-index: 1` to it.

```
.ring-red {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

```

Another solution would be to add a `z-index: -1` to the purple ring. This will make it behind the red ring.

### Example 2: Feeding the duck

The duck is very hungry and it’s stuck inside the red ring since the red ring has a stacking context.

How can we make the fish closer to the duck, so it can eat?

```
<div class="water">
   <div class="ring ring-red">
     <div class="duck"></div>
   </div>
   <div class="fish fish-small"></div>
   <div class="fish fish-large"></div>
</div>
```

The red ring is rotated a bit and it has a CSS transform applied. This created a new stacking context.

```
.water {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

.ring-red {
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}

```

By removing the stacking context from the ring, the fish will be in front of the ring. That way, the duck can eat.

Based on the source order, the fish should come first since it's the last element in the HTML.

```
.water {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

.ring-red {
  transform: none;
}

```

### Example 3: z-index: 9999

In this example, the fish has a higher `z-index` than the red ring.

```
<div class="water">
   <div class="ring ring-red">
     <div class="duck"></div>
   </div>
   <div class="fish fish-large"></div>
</div>
```

```
.water {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

.fish {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
}

.ring-red {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

```

How can we move the duck in front of the fish? It's impossible. If we apply a `z-index` to the duck, it will only have meaning within its stacking context (the red ring). Even with a `z-index: 9999`, it won't do anything.

```
.duck {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 9999;
}

```

What's tricky about `z-index` is that it only works within an element's stacking context. In our case, we want the duck, which is a part of the red ring stacking context, to be in front of the fish (Another stacking context). This isn't possible.

To make the duck appear in front of the fish, we need to remove the stacking context from the red ring.

```
.fish {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
}

.duck {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

.ring-red {
  position: static;
  z-index: auto;
}

```

By doing this, the current stacking context for the duck and the fish is the water element.

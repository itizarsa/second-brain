# We centralize the main features of your everyday tools (PRs, CI, Kanban tasks) and build a live feed of everything.

Hetchr aggregates a "quick view" of your team's development status and gives you a way to manage tasks directly from our platform.

# Introducing ATOMs.The building blocks of your workspace.

ATOMs are a new way to interact with your engineering tools: pick and choose what you want to see.

Connect your existing tools and use our custom ATOMs to get a full view of your project's status. Monitor progress, centralize notifications, and keep the whole team on the same page. We help you read and write data directly from our interface, without the need to switch context.

A thread üßµ

Let‚Äôs divide the overall negotiation process in two stages :
 1.  The interview process before negotiation
 2.  Negotiation stage and beyond

Don‚Äôt jump the gun. Keep these two parts separate and don‚Äôt mix them.

Before the negotiation even starts with the recruiter, one negotiates with themselves. It‚Äôs your inner discussion with yourself and this is extremely important.

To be paid what you‚Äôre worth, you first have to fully understand your worth to the organization. Most candidates don‚Äôt know the standards they are being measured by, so they determine their value based on their own ideals.

You have to ask questions.

There is some amount of self work needed to get ST1 and ST2 on the same page. They should have one truth, one fact, and should be in sync. You will be able to justify and put forth what you believe in and out!

In negotiation, the shortest distance between two points is not a straight line. So don‚Äôt go directly on what you want.

The most important rule:

Never give the numbers first, NEVER!

Before you start negotiating have your ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù ready in a form of list. This is a major mistake candidates do and negotiations change into bargain.

In negotiation all the stakeholders win, even if marginally whereas in bargain someone looses for sure!

Have your bottom line, anything below that and you will be ready to walk away but at the same time offer flexibility to the recruiter to be able to work out a deal which is win-win.

While you share your issues which you wish to negotiate, make it transparent.

Never negotiate over email, always prefer: Face to face (in person or zoom) or voice, in that order.

What you might want to communicate can really be misunderstood over email/msg.

Navigate the negotiation process carefully! Sometimes your skills are being tested more than the core objective of it being Carried out!

Last and my favorite:

You MUST NEVER take up a job which isn‚Äôt a fit for you irrespective of all the perks and compensation.

Make sure you are passionate about it, you will see things falling in place if not immediately, in due course.

Good luck üçÄ

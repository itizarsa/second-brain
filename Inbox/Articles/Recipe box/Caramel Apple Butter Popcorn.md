# Shopping List

- [ ]  3 1/2 c unsalted popped popcorn
- [ ]  1/3 c packed brown sugar
- [ ]  1/4 c (2 oz or 4 tbsp) unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
- [ ]  1/4 c apple butter
- [ ]  2 tbsp corn syrup

- [ ]  1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- [ ]  1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
- [ ]  1/4 tsp salt
- [ ]  1/4 tsp baking soda
- [ ]  1/4 tsp vanilla extract

# Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 250F. Lightly grease a 13x9 pan and add the popcorn.
2. In a medium heavy saucepan, add the brown sugar, butter, apple butter, corn syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring often. Once boiling, cook without stirring for 5 minutes.
3. Remove from the heat and stir in the baking soda (it may foam a bit) then stir in the vanilla. Quickly pour over the popcorn and stir until evenly distributed.
4. Bake 60-75 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes, or until the coating is mainly dry (it's ok if it's a little sticky when stirring the final time). Remove from the pan and cool completely. Best eaten the day it's made. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days.

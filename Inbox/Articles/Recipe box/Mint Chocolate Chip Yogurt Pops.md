# Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, greek yogurt, vanilla, peppermint extract.

Sprinkle the tops of the pops with the mini chocolate chips, some will settle through while the pops freeze. If you would like additional chips mixed in, mix in a few additional mini chocolate chips using the popsicle sticks. Place sticks in the pops to freeze.

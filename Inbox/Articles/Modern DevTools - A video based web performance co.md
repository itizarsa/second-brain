I'm passionate about DevTools, here are some things I've done related to it:

- Firstly, this *isn't* my first Developer Tools course. I made one a [long time ago](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/chrome-developer-tools) and it became the most watched code course of that year! ([proof](https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/2014-a-year-in-tuts-content--cms-22835))

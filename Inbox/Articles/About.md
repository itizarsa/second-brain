Being in the software development industry for more than 7 years now. I have got the opportunity to learn from some really talented people who were kind enough to teach me.
If you find yourself asking any one of the following question(s):
- How to plan and prepare for coding interviews?
- Should I do projects or competitive programming?
- Why my resume doesn’t get shortlisted?
- How do I grow in my career?
- How do I build credibility at work?
- How do I make my LinkedIn profile stand out?
- How can I create visibility in the team?
You can drop me a LinkedIn message or use "Request a connect" from the featured section and fill the form.
I'll set up a (google meet) session with you. There will be a maximum of 4 people in a session, who have similar questions.
𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞:
𝐈𝐟 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚 𝐢𝐬 𝐍𝐎𝐓 𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐞𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡. 𝐈'𝐥𝐥 𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐭, 𝐬𝐨 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮'𝐫𝐞 𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭.
I do NOT charge anything for these sessions. I truly want to help you while learning from your experience.
Now, if you're holding back because you think there is a hidden charge which I shall reveal later! Please note.
I expect only a few things from you.
- Please do NOT ask about something that can be easily googled.
- Please make sure you describe your question in detail.
- After the session, share your experience in form of feedback so that I can help better.

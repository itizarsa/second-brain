I recently received this gem of a note::

> Hi Charity, I really enjoy your writing and a lot of it has directly contributed to me finally deciding to leave a company with a toxic management culture. I‚Äôll also be leaving many great IC friends that will have lost a strong voice. My exit interview will be next week. Any advice on how honest I should be? I‚Äôve googled quite a bit but there are only generic ‚Äúdon‚Äôt burn bridges‚Äù comments. Would love to see something a little more authoritative üôÇ ‚ÄìAnonymous Reader

Ew, fuck that. That‚Äôs exactly the kind of quivering, self-serving, ass covering advice you‚Äôd get from HR. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of advice that good people use to perpetuate harm.

I wouldn‚Äôt worry about ‚Äútoo much honesty‚Äù or personal repercussions or whatnot. I would worry about just one thing: being **effective**. This is your last chance to do the people you care about a solid, and you don‚Äôt want to waste it.

So ‚Ä¶ ranting about every awful person, boring project and offensive party theme of your tenure: not effective. Ranting about people who were personally irritating but had very limited power: not effective. Talking only in vague, high level abstractions (‚Äútoxic culture‚Äù), or about things only engineers understand and are bugged by: *not effective.*

What is effective? Hm, let‚Äôs think on this..

- Start off with your high level assertion (toxic culture) and methodically assemble a list of stories, incidents, and consequences that support your thesis. Structure-wise, this is a lot like writing a good essay
- Tie your critiques to the higher ups who enabled or encouraged the bad behavior, not just the flunkies who carried it out.
- Wherever possible, draw a straight line to material consequences ‚Äî people quitting, customers leaving, your company‚Äôs reputation suffering
- Keep it crisp. **No more than three pages** total. Pick your top 1-3 points and drive them home. No detours.

- This one sucks, but ‚Ä¶ if someone was perceived as an underperformer or a problem employee, avoid using them as evidence in support of your argument. It won‚Äôt help you or them, it will be used as an excuse to discredit you.
- Keep it mostly professional. I am not saying don‚Äôt show *any* anger or strong emotion; it can be a powerful tool; just be careful with it. Get a proofread from someone with upper management experience, ideally with no connection to your work. (Me, if necessary.)
- ‚ú®**Put it in WRITING**!‚ú® Deliver your feedback in person, but hand over a written copy as well. Written words are harder to ignore or distort.
- For extra oomph, give a copy to any execs, managers, or high level ICs you trust. Don‚Äôt just email it to them, though. Have a face to face conversation where you state your case, and hand them a written copy at the end.

The sad fact is that most exit feedback is dutifully entered in by a low ranking employee who makes a third your salary and has no reason whatsoever to rock the boat, after which it gets tossed in a folder or the trash and is never seen again.

If you want to use your voice on your way out the door, the challenge you face isn‚Äôt one of retribution, it‚Äôs inertia and apathy. HR doesn‚Äôt care about your feedback ‚Ä¶ but they care if they think their boss saw it and cares about it

And I think you *should* use your voice! You clearly have some clout, and what‚Äôs the point of having power if you won‚Äôt extend yourself now and then on behalf of those who don‚Äôt?

Good luck!!

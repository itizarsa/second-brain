These Inclusive Design Principles are about putting people first. It's about designing for the needs of people with permanent, temporary, situational, or changing disabilities â€” all of us really.

They are intended to give anyone involved in the design and development of websites and applications - designers, user experience professionals, developers, product owners, idea makers, innovators, artists and thinkers - a broad approach to inclusive design.

The principles are also available to hang on your wall as [a set of illustrated posters (2MB)](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/posters/posters.zip) by [@BarclaysAccess](https://twitter.com/BarclaysAccess).

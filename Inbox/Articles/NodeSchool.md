NodeSchool is decentralized, open source and volunteer run. Want to host an event? [Resources and tips](https://nodeschool.io/host.html) for how.

`npm install -g learnyounode`

You’ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer to get started with each of these. Then use [npm](https://npmjs.org/) (it comes with Node) to install each module with the command below it. Once installed, simply type the workshopper’s name to launch.

You will also need a **Text Editor**, if you don't have one already, you may want one for editing code. A few options: [Atom](https://www.atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

Problems with the workshopper? Try installing the latest version of Node.js (v6.2.0 or higher), or ask a question in the [discussion](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues/new).

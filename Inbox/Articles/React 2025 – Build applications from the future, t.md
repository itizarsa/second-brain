## “Building modern web apps is too difficult.”

Have you tried to launch a project only to get stuck trying to do it "the right way"? I've been there. I'd waste time dealing with complex tech instead of shipping products. Then, I started building apps like it's 2025.

And more time doing the things you **love.**

## Transform front-end to full-stack.

Are you frustrated with how long it takes to go from idea to production? As a front-end developer, I wanted to **bring my ideas to life.** Not just the front-end, but the full stack.

Then, I discovered the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.wtf/) and the optimal workflow for front-end developers.

1. Build dynamic applications that become static.
2. Push code to a repository with Git.
3. Deploy instantly to a global CDN.

"React 2025 helped me **leave my front-end comfort zone** and expand into the full stack." –– Joe Bell

## Not your typical course.

Are you tired of courses that don't show real-world applications? In my last course, I showed how to build an application with a database, authentication, and more. But I never launched it.

This course will show the journey from zero lines of code to production for a real SaaS app. This isn't another example. At the end of the course, **I launched the product.**

## What we're building.

In this course, we'll build Fast Feedback – the easiest way to add reviews and comments to your site. You can try it out [here.](https://fastfeedback.io/)

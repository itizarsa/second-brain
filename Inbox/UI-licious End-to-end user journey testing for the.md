You expect software to work perfectly, so do your users.

UI-licious is everything you need to test and continuously monitor end-to-end user journeys across multiple browsers and resolutions.

Catch defects before users do.

[Create a test](https://snippet.uilicious.com/test/public/LrAbLdXVbH3GhoKVLT7cMw)

It's free, no sign in required.

## Test user journeys, not HTML.

Stop writing brittle tests with hard-coded CSS, XPATH selectors and waits. 
 Write tests that are meaningful to people, effortless to maintain, and reusable.

```
I.goTo("https://github.com/login")
I.fill("Email", "john@example.com")
I.fill("Password", "supersecretpassword")
I.click("Sign in")
I.see("Incorrect username or password.")
```

Use variables, loops, conditionals, and functions 
 for more complex scenarios.

UI-licious works on good old static sites, SSR sites, modern SPA applications, and even on Web Components.

Yup, even IE11.

## UI-licious is built for TEAMs.

UI-licious isn't just for QAs. 
 UI-licious is designed for the entire product team 
 - devs, managers, designers, marketing - to help you **express, simulate, and validate User Journeys**, 
 and define unambiguously what is a defect.

### Show, not tell

Save the hassle of asking who, what, when, where, how. 
 Share rich bug reproduction reports with your team to show them exactly what went wrong.

UI-licious automatically captures screenshots, exact urls, page titles, times and durations, with every step to help you swiftly diagnose issues.

### Swap test data and keep secrets safe

Store environment variables and secrets with Datasets. 
 Datasets lets you run the same test with different test data, to test different environments. 
 Redact sensitive information like passwords from reports with secret variables.

### Setup schedules and error alerts

Schedule tests to run automatically, and alert your team whenever there's a failure!

Get error alerts via Email, Slack, MS Teams, and Webhooks

## Trusted by QAs, devs, and managers

Without any coding experience, it took me less than a day to learn an adapt UI-licious. After I had an intro to Javascript, it became an even more powerful tool in my hand.

With UI-licious, we've significantly increased our deployment confidence, without increasing engineering cost or release cycle time.

With scheduled jobs and automatic alerts, developers and managers get Slack notification about every bug. It's a never-ending ongoing testing that saves me at least one hour every day.

UI-licious is really approachable. We were using Selenium before, which only our engineers could maintain. But our non-technical testers were able to learn UI-licious really quickly.

Testing with [@ui_licious](https://twitter.com/ui_licious) is a breeze! Love the scripting language. Tests look almost like functional spec in English.

# Move fast,  Break things  Build what people want.

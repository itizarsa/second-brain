I’m a programmer and maker of things. Currently into Swift and Node.js. Aspiring rebel by heart. I created [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) with

[Addy Osmani](https://medium.com/u/2508e4c7a8ec?source=post_page-----42786d2e191b--------------------------------)

and some other friends, and I’m the creator of [AVA](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava), [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo), [Pageres](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres), [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk), and a [few more node modules](https://www.npmjs.com/~sindresorhus). I also run the [Awesome](https://awesome.re/) project.

I was recently [interviewed](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/sindre-sorhus-8426c0ed785d) by Between the Wires if you’re curious about my story.

I love doing open source and creating human friendly tools. When doing so, I value succinct code with clear intent, and I make [small focused modules](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/10#issuecomment-117766328) and compose them to build larger and more complex things.

This is my first blog. I realize I’m years late to the game. I finally now have time to write about stuff. Follow this blog if you like unicorns, dinosaurs, open source, Swift, Node.js, JavaScript, workflow tips, technical insights, and goofy humor.

This describes me pretty well.

I’m currently doing open-source full-time, [fully funded by the community](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/963478258808340482) 🙌.

I live in Bangkok. Say *hi* if you’re around!

Frameworks are awesome, and Javascript has a ton of them, both for frontend and for backend. They make life a lot simpler – sometimes.

But sometimes, the learning curve of learning a framework is simply not worth the effort.

Frameworkless.js is a tutorial series to help get you up and running with your own awesome app built almost entirely from Node.js and plain, vanilla javascript.

## What frameworkless.js covers

- An HTTP server using Node's own `http` module
- Routing and templating
- Using plain SQL instead of ORMs, and how to work it safely
- Forms – not always needing Ajax!
- Frontend assets – how to set up CSS and Javascript pre-processors
- Does your frontend really need a framework to be "reactive"?
- Finishing touches: Gzip, Pjax, and more
- Writing tests with Node.js's `assert` library

## Method

We are going to build a real live app together. Seriously.

No fake assignments like incrementing counters with a click of a button. We're going to gradually build, from start to finish, a whole app.

## Who is this course for?

You should have some basic Javascript knowledge. CSS and HTML are obviously a plus. The course will be a series of videos in english, but I'm not Shakespeare – if you can read this page, you will be able to understand my videos even if English is your second (or third or fourth or nth) language.

## What does it cost?

The base material will be free, for everyone, forever.

I will probably add some more advanced paid tutorials, however.
